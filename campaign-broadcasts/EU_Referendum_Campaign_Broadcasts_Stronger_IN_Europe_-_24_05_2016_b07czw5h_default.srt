1
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:27,160
This is Sam. He's 14 months old.

2
03:13:27,160 --> 03:13:31,120
How you vote in the European Referendum will shape his future

3
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:33,640
and the future of everyone in our country.

4
03:13:33,640 --> 03:13:35,320
If we remain in Europe,

5
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:37,680
there'll be more opportunities for our children

6
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:41,040
to follow their dreams and make the most out of life

7
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:43,960
because being in Europe helps our businesses grow

8
03:13:43,960 --> 03:13:47,720
and create jobs, giving young people the chance to learn a trade,

9
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:51,680
get into work and get on in life.

10
03:13:55,400 --> 03:13:56,920
People setting up a new business

11
03:13:56,920 --> 03:14:00,120
can trade freely with customers across Europe,

12
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:02,160
helping them build something of their own

13
03:14:02,160 --> 03:14:04,040
and create jobs for others.

14
03:14:08,280 --> 03:14:11,720
Companies from around the world set up factories and offices here

15
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:14,240
so that they can do business throughout Europe,

16
03:14:14,240 --> 03:14:18,120
meaning more opportunities for Sam and everyone in our country.

17
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:24,920
And when you're at work, your rights are secured by EU legislation -

18
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:27,880
paid holiday and sick leave, equal rights,

19
03:14:27,880 --> 03:14:29,920
maternity and paternity leave -

20
03:14:29,920 --> 03:14:31,960
all protected by EU law.

21
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:37,600
Being in Europe also means families enjoy lower prices

22
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:40,520
in our shops and supermarkets.

23
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:46,880
This saves an average household £350 a year so as Sam grows older,

24
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:49,520
he'll have more money to put aside for a deposit on a home

25
03:14:49,520 --> 03:14:52,600
or a car or a holiday with his family.

26
03:14:53,960 --> 03:14:57,240
Remaining in Europe will keep our economy stronger

27
03:14:57,240 --> 03:15:00,080
so we can invest more in vital services

28
03:15:00,080 --> 03:15:04,120
like schools and the NHS and it means Sam and all of us

29
03:15:04,120 --> 03:15:06,560
have the freedom to travel, study,

30
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:11,200
work and live wherever we want across the EU.

31
03:15:12,600 --> 03:15:15,720
And Sam and every child in our country will grow up in a Britain

32
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:20,480
that leads in the world, that works with others to tackle the big issues

33
03:15:20,480 --> 03:15:22,960
like climate change and terrorism.

34
03:15:24,240 --> 03:15:26,960
But leaving the EU would mean losing all of this.

35
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:32,880
It's a leap in the dark and would leave UK families £4,300 worse off.

36
03:15:35,080 --> 03:15:38,320
So, on June 23rd, vote for more opportunities

37
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:41,520
and a stronger future for Sam and everyone you know -

38
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:45,560
your family and friends, your children and grandchildren.

39
03:15:46,920 --> 03:15:50,680
Vote for a Britain that's stronger, safer and better off.
