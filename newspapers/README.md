Newspaper front pages from days leading up to and beyond the referendum

Currently only UK newspapers are included to keep the size of the repository small, except for on the 25th June, where a few other countries have been included as this was the day that print media was able to publish their reaction to the result.

A full archive including many more countries will be added to a seperate repository and linked from here.
