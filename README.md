# EU Referendum Datasets

Data from the 23rd June EU Referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain in or leave the European Union.

## guardian-results.json

Will be removed if/when The Guardian makes it easily accessible themselves.

## petition-counts.json

Totals of all signature counts on a petition calling for a second referendum. Grouped by country and UK constituency. Pulled from https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215.json and updated once a minute

### More data to be added soon

I'll take it any data if requested, but I feel this is too important not to be shared.
