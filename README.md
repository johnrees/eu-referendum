# EU Referendum Datasets

Data from the 23rd June EU Referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain in or leave the European Union.

## guardian-results.json

Voting counts and results per constituency in the UK.

Will be removed if/when The Guardian makes it easily accessible themselves.

Taken directly from http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis

### More data to be added soon

I'll take it any data if requested, but I feel this is too important not to be shared.
