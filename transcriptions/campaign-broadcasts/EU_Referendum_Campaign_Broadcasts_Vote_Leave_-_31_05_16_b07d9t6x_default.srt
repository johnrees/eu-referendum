1
05:02:39,480 --> 05:02:41,760
If you correctly predict all the results

2
05:02:41,760 --> 05:02:43,600
in the European Football Championship,

3
05:02:43,600 --> 05:02:47,400
- I'll give you five quid. 
- Five quid? If I predict the scores?

4
05:02:47,400 --> 05:02:49,360
Just to win or draw.

5
05:02:49,360 --> 05:02:51,280
What are the odds on that?

6
05:02:51,280 --> 05:02:53,960
In that case, Kevin, I'll bet you 50 quid.

7
05:02:53,960 --> 05:02:57,320
- I'll make it £50,000. 
- All right, then I'll raise you.

8
05:02:57,320 --> 05:03:00,160
- £50 million. 
- £50 million, Gary?

9
05:03:00,160 --> 05:03:02,520
That's as much we give the EU every day.

10
05:03:02,520 --> 05:03:04,760
It's your chance to win it, Kev.

11
05:03:04,760 --> 05:03:08,160
- You can finally buy that Picasso. 
- My favourite artist, Gary.

12
05:03:08,160 --> 05:03:09,760
And your chance, too.

13
05:03:09,760 --> 05:03:11,440
It's free to enter.

14
05:03:11,440 --> 05:03:13,680
Just fill in the form at 50million.uk

15
05:03:13,680 --> 05:03:16,240
and if you correctly predict all the outcomes

16
05:03:16,240 --> 05:03:18,640
from the European Football Championship this summer,

17
05:03:18,640 --> 05:03:20,760
you could win £50 million.

18
05:03:21,880 --> 05:03:23,880
Go to 50million.uk now

19
05:03:23,880 --> 05:03:26,760
and you could win £50 million.

20
05:03:26,760 --> 05:03:29,320
You just log on to 50million.uk,

21
05:03:29,320 --> 05:03:30,920
click "sign up",

22
05:03:30,920 --> 05:03:33,000
then you pick which team wins

23
05:03:33,000 --> 05:03:36,840
or whether it's a draw for each game, and that's it. Good luck.

24
05:03:36,840 --> 05:03:38,680
Gary, Turkey or Albania?

25
05:03:38,680 --> 05:03:41,400
- Well, they're both joining the EU, aren't they? 
- Yes, I know,

26
05:03:41,400 --> 05:03:43,200
but which one do you think will win?

27
05:03:43,200 --> 05:03:45,400
Well, Turkey's got 76 million people,

28
05:03:45,400 --> 05:03:48,640
- so they should have a good team. 
- Turkey it is, then, Gary.

29
05:03:51,600 --> 05:03:53,560
Fancy some quinoa?

30
05:03:53,560 --> 05:03:56,520
Quinoa? I think you mean "keen-wah", Gary.

31
05:03:56,520 --> 05:03:58,720
I think I prefer chips.

32
05:03:58,720 --> 05:04:01,440
Hey! Fancy a kickabout?

33
05:04:01,440 --> 05:04:04,960
Gary, mind the late-19th-century paintings.

34
05:04:04,960 --> 05:04:07,680
We're multimillionaires now, Kev.

35
05:04:09,680 --> 05:04:12,600
Did you know a Member of the European Parliament gets paid

36
05:04:12,600 --> 05:04:14,400
- £75,000 a year? 
- How much?

37
05:04:14,400 --> 05:04:16,600
And 45 grand expenses.

38
05:04:16,600 --> 05:04:20,520
Get out. I heard they get 300-euro-a-day expenses

39
05:04:20,520 --> 05:04:22,320
just for turning up.

40
05:04:22,320 --> 05:04:25,360
Hey, Gazza, we should have been MEPs.

41
05:04:25,360 --> 05:04:28,360
Stroke of luck we won that 50 million, eh, Kev?

42
05:04:28,360 --> 05:04:30,000
I wonder who's doing our jobs now.

43
05:04:30,000 --> 05:04:32,480
Probably someone charging half the price.

44
05:04:32,480 --> 05:04:34,920
Lucky we got out when we did.

45
05:04:34,920 --> 05:04:36,680
THEY LAUGH THEN SIGH

46
05:05:00,240 --> 05:05:02,600
MUSIC PLAYS

47
05:05:06,280 --> 05:05:08,200
SHE COUGHS
