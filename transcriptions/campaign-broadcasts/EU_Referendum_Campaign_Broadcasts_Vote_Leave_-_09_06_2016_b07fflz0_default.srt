00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
At the end of the war, Britain created the NHS.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It protects us throughout our lives.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But it's in danger. You can help it.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Every week we send ?350 million to Brussels.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Money that's wasted.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's enough to build a new hospital every week.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It will get worse.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The euro is broken, and the EU plans to let in another five countries.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Imagine what will happen when you're paying for the euro bailouts.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Imagine what will happen to public services

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
when Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey join the EU.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Imagine our money being spent on our priorities.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You can make this happen. This might be our last chance.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, vote leave on 23rd June.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's take back control.

Every week we send ?350 million to Brussels.

23
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Money that's wasted.

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's enough to build a new hospital every week.

25
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It will get worse.

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000

Imagine what will happen to public services

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
when Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey join the EU.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Imagine our money being spent on our priorities.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can make this happen.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This might be our last chance.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, vote leave on 23rd June.
