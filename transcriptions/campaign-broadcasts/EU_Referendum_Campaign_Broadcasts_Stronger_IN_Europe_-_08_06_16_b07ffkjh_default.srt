1
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,160
Let me tell you, as a businessman for 50 years,

2
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,160
businesses do not want uncertainty.

3
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,200
Now, granted the EU is not the perfect place, far from it.

4
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,040
But you don't sort something out by running away from it.

5
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,480
You stick at it and you make it better

6
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,240
and you take advantage of what it offers -

7
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,560
of the 500 million customers that we can sell to,

8
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,720
of the foreign investors desperate to spend their cash here,

9
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,960
of the opportunities for our children and grandchildren.

10
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,880
Because this vote isn't just for our generation, it's for theirs.

11
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,280
Let me put it in very plain terms - this is not a general election.

12
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
This is not something that's going to come around in five years' time.

13
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,320
Oh, it didn't work. OK, well, we'll have another vote. No, no.

14
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
This is the most serious vote you most probably will ever make.

15
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,680
What we get as being a member of the European Union is full access

16
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,280
to the biggest market of consumers in the world -

17
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,720
over 500 million people -

18
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,320
and our ability to trade very freely with all of those economies.

19
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,680
For ordinary households, then, that means a wider range

20
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,360
of employment opportunities, hopefully higher-waged jobs

21
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,840
than they might otherwise get and potentially lower prices

22
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,120
than in a scenario where we left the European Union.

23
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Of course, we don't know exactly what would happen if we left,

24
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
but that very uncertainty for economists

25
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,440
is something we would worry about.

26
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,920
The wages, the jobs,

27
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,080
the living standards of millions of British workers

28
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,880
directly depend upon our trading relationship

29
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,440
with the rest of Europe.

30
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,560
Many of the most important rights and protections that workers enjoy

31
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,960
in Britain depend on European measures.

32
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,160
The maternity rights, the right to paid holidays,

33
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,080
decent treatment of agency workers, part-time workers -

34
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
all of these things are underpinned by Europe

35
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,440
and are guaranteed by Europe and all would be at risk if we left.

36
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,600
None of the threats to our security and safety

37
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,280
have a single-nation solution.

38
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,680
The European Union is based on the simple principle

39
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,440
that there's safety in numbers.

40
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,320
Coming out of the European Union

41
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,880
would weaken Britain's voice in the world,

42
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,200
weaken our influence at a pivotal time in world history.

43
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,080
Europe is a wonderful continent,

44
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,480
but it's also the place where two terrible world wars began.

45
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,840
And those wars happened because of excessive competition,

46
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,760
rivalry and hate between nations.

47
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,480
That's been replaced in recent decades by family, community,

48
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,560
cooperation, collaboration

49
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,480
and that's what we need more than ever going forward.

50
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,480
Scientists know that progress comes from cooperation.

51
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,440
By working together in Europe we make our economy stronger,

52
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,760
we give ourselves more influence in the world

53
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,240
and we provide future opportunities for young people.

54
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,800
And leaving Europe would threaten Britain's status as a world leader

55
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,520
in science and innovation.

56
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,080
It's just not a risk worth taking.

57
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,840
On June 23, let's vote to make sure

58
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,400
Britain has a strong future in Europe.
