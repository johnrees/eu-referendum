1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The brutal killing of MP Jo Cox has shocked the nation and paused

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,989
the referendum debate, just days before voting.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,989
Had we become, on all sides, simply too angry

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,989
This morning, the big question about our national future returns,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:41,989
with perhaps, we'll see, a rather different tone.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,989
My guests today include the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn,

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,989
and the joint leader of the Leave campaign, the Justice

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,989
Two more politicians in our papers review this morning -

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,989
Conservative Remainer and unlikely king of Twitter Sir Nicholas Soames.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,989
And the leading Out campaigner Labour's Kate Hoey.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,989
And we're joined too by the Sun's star columnist Jane Moore.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,989
Plus, music from one of the hottest young stars in Britain,

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,989
But first, the news, with Steph McGovern.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,989
Two special church services will be held at Birstall in West Yorkshire

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,989
this morning to remember the local MP Jo Cox,

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,989
Thomas Mair, who is accused of her murder, appeared

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,989
in court in London yesterday and was remanded in custody.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,989
He will appear at the Old Bailey tomorrow.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:54,989
A day of remembrance ahead for this village in West Yorkshire.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,989
Three days after the killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,989
campaigning in the EU referendum has started up again.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,989
The Justice Secretary, Michael Gove, who wants to leave,

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,989
insists Britain could be a "progressive beacon"

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,989
David Cameron has urged voters to reject Nigel Farage's vision

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,989
for the country which, he claimed, would "divide rather than unite".

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,989
Health unions have written to David Cameron urging him not

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,989
to scrap nursing and midwifery bursaries in England.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,989
The Government says that replacing grants with student loans

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,989
will provide funding for many more training places.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,989
But the Royal College of Nursing says that the plans would be

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:42,989
a "reckless gamble" with the future of the NHS workforce.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,989
A day of remembrance ahead for this village in West Yorkshire.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,989
Later this morning, church services will

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,989
be held and a book of condolences opened for those who wish to

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,989
to pay their respects for Jo Cox, who was killed on Thursday, as she

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,989
made her way here, to her constituency surgery.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,989
Yesterday, the MP's family, surrounded by the

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,989
people of Birstall, came to the place where she was attacked.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,989
Her sister, Kim Leadbeater, said Jo would never

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,989
She will live on through all the good people in the world.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,989
Through Brendan, through us, and through her

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,989
truly wonderful children, who will always know what an utterly

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,989
She was a human being and she was perfect.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,989
People have been reacting to the 41-year-old's death across

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,989
A fund set up in her name has already raised hundreds of thousands

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,989
Meanwhile, yesterday, the man accused of killing the MP,

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,989
When asked his name, he replied, "death to

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,989
He is also charged with grievous bodily

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,989
harm against a 77-year-old man who came to her aid

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,989
The 52-year-old was remanded in custody and will appear

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,989
There have been disturbances in the Turkish city of Istanbul,

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,989
following an attack on fans of the British rock band Radiohead.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,989
Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of people protesting

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,989
The fans, who had gathered at a music store to listen

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,989
to the band's latest album, were reportedly targeted

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,989
for drinking alcohol and playing music during Ramadan.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:58,989
Those words by the murdered MP's sister, she was perfect, dominate

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,989
some of the papers. Because of legal problems, cannot talk much about

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,989
this, so you will have to forgive us. This one, like a lot of the

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,989
Sunday papers, finally make up -- makes up its mind on Europe. The

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,989
Sunday Times, slightly hedging its bets, you might think, with David,

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,989
talking about the dangers of leaving. Michael Gove has given

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,989
interviews in lots of the papers, and we will be talking to him later

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,989
on. And there's Jo Cox's parents- we know there are some some evil people

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,989
in this world, but there are an awful lot of good people, too. .

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,989
Looking at the opinion polls, this does in deed appear to be the case,

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,989
Britain split down the middle. You met Jo Cox a few times? Only

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,989
slightly. I met her as a colleague, really, in the lobbies. And I think

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,989
Kate was in the same position. We knew her as a new member of

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,989
Parliament. I was most impressed by her ability to work across the

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,989
issues, cross-party, like Kate and I have done on immigration and other

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,989
matters. If you want to get anything done in the House of Commons, you

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,989
have to work cross-party, and she was a doer. I loved the story by

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,989
Andrew Mitchell, in the Telegraph, saying that he took her to talk to

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,989
the Russian ambassador, to talk about Syria, and she gave the

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,989
Russian ambassador what for and he was doubly chastened. And he is a

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,989
tough guy. Yes, and she gave him what for. I am very taken by the

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,989
last article she wrote, which the Mail on Sunday reprints today in

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,989
which she talks very eloquently about the Remain campaign. That was

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,989
the context in which I met her. We were both members of the cross-party

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,989
Remain campaign. I think she writes very powerfully and knowledgeably

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,989
about the migrants and the need to curb migrants, but also to do it in

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,989
a sensible and humane way. And of course her husband has pick up the

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,989
torch and is tweeting and writing everywhere as well. What was

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,989
remarkable, having only been a member of Parliament for such a

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,989
short time, she was so well-known for the causes that she was working

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,989
cross-party on. And I think also, what has come through very much, and

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,989
I think all MPs will be so touched by that, the effect within her own

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,989
constituency of her own constituents and the help that she had given

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,989
them. It is one area of MPs' lives which can get ignored by the media,

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,989
that day today, we are all doing I think pretty good work. But she

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,989
particularly seems to have done that in that short time. She was from the

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,989
area, it was her home area. I think the papers have all done some

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,989
wonderful tributes to her. It is interesting, Sir Nicholas was saying

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,989
that she was a cross-party kind of MP. And she has got cross-party

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,989
tributes, from right across the press. Absolutely. As you just said,

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,989
she was perfect. It is the whole thing off, she was a human being.

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,989
How her sister stood up and made that speech, all credit to her.

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,989
Absolutely incredible. You just look at what happens when somebody... It

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,989
is about their parents, their siblings, their children. But as you

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,989
rightly say, Kate, the constituents. And these pictures of the sea of

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,989
flowers, and when she was first killed, the reporters, who normally

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,989
they do vox pops of people on the streets, people were actually

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,989
crying. And they all had personal stories of how she had helped them.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,989
People think Westminster is full of career politicians who have no...

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,989
There is a lot of abuse of politicians. And I think Jo Cox and

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,989
her tragic story has highlighted that there are a lot of on the

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,989
ground MPs, doing the job as it should be done. Sir Nicholas, have

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,989
you noticed an additional aggression in recent years towards MPs, and how

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,989
do you deal with it? You need want to go out and meet your

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,989
constituents, you do not want to be surrounded by police or whatever. We

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,989
shall go on with our surgeries as we have always done. Nevertheless, I

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,989
think it is an important point - the job of the MP in the constituency is

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,989
to be round and about, and constantly so. Despite what you

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,989
would think, MPs are astonishingly accessible, at any time. But it has

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,989
changed, the public debate has coarsened, and there are a whole lot

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,989
of events which led up to that. It is now much rougher than it was. It

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,989
has always been a rough trade, Dubai to Hogarth. But it is now much more

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,989
vicious. Particularly so, for women. There was something in the Telegraph

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,989
yesterday listing the threats, and rape threats, made against women MPs

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,989
on all sides. Yes, and that is a result of social media, because it

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,989
is so instant. Somebody says something, and everybody else joins

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,989
in. Personally I just ignore things which come through, unless it is

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,989
something which is really, really threatening. Not just women MPs, TV

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,989
presenters, journalists... Anyone in public life. Look at the way our

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,989
nurses, our schoolteachers, I sometimes threatened. It is a

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,989
general coarsening of the public... In the Sunday Telegraph, James

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,989
Kirchhoff saying that this is going to divide the country further, he

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,989
thinks. Well, he's trying to move on from that, saying there will be a

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,989
lot of people for different reasons trying to link this with the

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,989
referendum. And I think this piece by James Kirkup is saying that it is

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,989
very, very important what happens after Thursday, that the tone of the

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,989
debate is kept in a way that people will not afterwards be able to work

134
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,989
together. He says the one certainty about the political consequences of

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,989
Jo Cox's awful death, the more it is linked into the referendum debate

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,989
are the harder it will be for people divided by that referendum to come

137
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,989
back together afterwards. I think that is really important. It is all

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,989
about tone? It is, and about people respecting other people's views,

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,989
even if they do not like them. Sir Nicholas, talking of which, Michael

140
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,989
Gove and yourself do not exactly share the same views as you on the

141
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,989
EU, but here's one of the most courteous men in British politics.

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,989
He is also a great friend, and I have great respect for him. There

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,989
are very profound views on both sides of this argument, that's why

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,989
it is so difficult for people to come to a conclusion. I take issue

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,989
only with his... He has written an interview in the Telegraph today,

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,989
Michael Gove, in which he says that a post-Brexit return you would be a

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,989
beacon of light. Well, I think Britain is a beacon of light

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,989
already. I think it is a begin of light, hope, internationalism and

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,989
diversity. I think people have always wanted to come here and they

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,989
always will. I don't think this is something related to Brexit or

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,989
non-Brexit. I think Britain has been a beacon of hope for generations. I

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,989
hope that when people make their minds up, they will consider that it

153
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,989
is a finely balanced argument, but it is not a new argument. You get

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,989
people saying to you that you are dishonouring the memory of your

155
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,989
grandfather, Sir Winston Churchill, by staying on the soccer lick side.

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,989
Have you found it pretty heated? I have found it very heated. People

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,989
say, your grandfather would be turning in his grave. How on earth

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,989
do they know? It is 50 years since he died. He started his public life

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,989
charging on a horse with a sword and ended up as Prime Minister ushering

160
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,989
in the nuclear age. It was likely that his views changed very

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,989
substantially over that period of time, and between then and now, I

162
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,989
cannot believe that he would not have a very different view possibly

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,989
on what he thought 80 years ago on the potential European Union. So it

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,989
is very difficult to say. On the other side of the argument, we have

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,989
got David Cameron, and object, self-imposed human nation awaits...?

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,989
Yes, but actually... I think, to be fair, he probably did not write the

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,989
headline! Following on from what Nicholas said, the language is so

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,989
important. He has said all the usual things which he has been saying. But

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,989
I picked out that he said, there is not one credible voice which it says

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,989
Britain, I think he means the United Kingdom, would be better off for

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,989
opting to leave the United Kingdom. Is he really saying that those four

172
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,989
or five members of his Cabinet, who are talking about how we could do so

173
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,989
well outside the EU, and how it would be much more democratic, is he

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,989
saying that they are not credible? I think this is a last-gasp attempt by

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,989
the Prime Minister, in a language, I have to say, much less strident than

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,989
he has been doing recently... The language is changing. The language

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,989
is changing, but here still wrong. He is referring to the Governor of

178
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,989
the Bank of England, the IMF, and that these views cannot be

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:07,989
dismissed. I am in a perfect position on this sofa. We have an

180
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,989
authentic ditherer. I am! I read an article which says we should remain,

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,989
and I go, yes! And then I read an article... I got hundreds of e-mails

182
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,989
from people saying, they are also undecided. We never talk about the

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,989
don't knows. But there's million is of you. I think there's lots of

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:40,989
bashful Brexit is! This is Donald Trump. He has given

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,989
an interview to the Sunday Times. He has said he will talk to him and

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,989
Putin, you will talk to them all. Everything he is asked, I think he

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,989
has had media training. He has become very measured and not

188
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,989
pejorative at all. Asked about the view of David Cameron where he said

189
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,989
he was divisive, stupid and wrong in saying he was going to ban all

190
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,989
Muslims from coming into America. His reply was, I respect David

191
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,989
Cameron. He does not know me. I respect what he has done and what he

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,989
is doing. I imagine I would have a very good relationship with him if I

193
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,989
were successful. Sir Nicolas Adams has been looking at China Daily on

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:49,989
his iPad. -- Sir Nicolas Soames. There was an interview. He became a

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,989
Member of Parliament in 1976. He has been around the track on all sorts

196
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,989
of occasions. He is a staunch, pro-European supporter of great

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,989
experience. In his piece to the china Daily come he is talking that

198
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,989
the complexities of trade with China and the point that, whatever one

199
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,989
says of the rights and wrongs in this argument, putting together a

200
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,989
trade deal with anyone is not easy. Making the point that to put a trade

201
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,989
deal with Britain alone with China will be very complicated. The

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,989
notable point is he has finally announced he is going and that will

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,989
be a big loss to Parliament. A big, clever, experienced man. Let's talk

204
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,989
about another clever and experienced man, Tim Peake, who has fallen to

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,989
earth. If you had spent the amount of time in space he had, it eat in

206
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,989
air dried food with boiling water poured on them, what would you crave

207
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,989
most? The me, it will be a juicy steak with a glass of red wine.

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,989
Apparently he has been craving pizza. And a beer. I'm with him on

209
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,989
the nice, cold beer that not the pizza. Earlier, this morning, I told

210
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,989
the man who had been on the shuttle, an American spacemen. He had been

211
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,989
dreaming about eating salad. That really is not much to look forward

212
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,989
to. I love that he landed in the first thing he said, which was

213
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,989
really charming, the fresh air. Smelling the flowers and the fresh

214
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,989
air. After being six months in a space craft, it must be an

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,989
extraordinary moment. The effect of gravity wearing off must be quite a

216
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,989
thing and he is on the way back to see his family now. He has got back

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,989
just on time for Father's Day. There is a short article in the Sunday

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,989
express written by Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. He is talking

219
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,989
about celebrating his third Father's Day as a dad. It is an interesting

220
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,989
article because he talks quite strongly against. It shows his real

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,989
determination to keep pushing the whole question of mental health and

222
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,989
the idea, the importance of having more resources into that whole area.

223
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,989
That will strike a chord with a lot of people. He is also pointing out

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,989
that dad is a very important. For some young men I see in my

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,989
constituency, sometimes young men feel devalued. They feel no one

226
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,989
really is interested in them. Sarah Baxter, rather movingly in the

227
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,989
Sunday Times. It is a fantastic piece which is quite curious. She

228
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,989
starts off by saying he was not around much because my parents split

229
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,989
up when I was nine and his job as a pilot took him away. She doesn't go

230
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,989
one to say... He had a belief in hand, that was the point. Her mother

231
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,989
played a very strong roll as well. I did not have a father figure in my

232
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,989
life. Single parents of either gender can do both. My husband has a

233
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,989
very strong relationship with our children and I do think, you know,

234
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,989
fathers are very, very important. The son of Leonard Cohen was saying,

235
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,989
what he valued about his father was he made a very good tuna salad. I

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,989
hope when I go, my kids will say, he made quite a good salad. Two

237
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,989
mentions of salad in the paper review. He would have thought? Are

238
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,989
you going to get a monstrous cake? If my children remember. After all

239
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,989
the publicity there has been, I hope they will. Thanks to you all.

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,989
Lovely this morning but what a grim old summer it's been so far.

241
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,989
I'm just a simple soul, who sits here patiently week after week

242
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,989
waiting for Peter Gibbs to bring me some happy news.

243
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:11,989
If you do not have any good news, make it up.

244
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,989
The sun is shining at the moment across the east of Scotland. A

245
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,989
beautiful start to the day. It will not last. Rain clouds are gathering

246
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,989
in the West. The rain is beginning to moving across Northern Ireland

247
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,989
and it will spread into Scotland, Wales and the western side of

248
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,989
England by the afternoon. It means we hang on to a bit of sunshine. The

249
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,989
easternmost counties of England in particular. Much warmer than

250
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,989
yesterday, up to 21, 22 in Norfolk. The high teens at best weather wind

251
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,989
and rain is piling in further west. The rain will continue to march

252
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,989
eastwards overnight so we will see a spell of wet weather. It will be a

253
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,989
fairly mild night with temperatures no lower than 14, 15 degrees. A bit

254
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,989
of a wet start to be Day across the southern half of England and Wales a

255
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,989
wet journey to work in many places. Sunny spells and showers following

256
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,989
on behind. There are signs that through the middle part of the week

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,989
we could see warmer, more humid air from the near continent. That could

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,989
well produce thundery showers. That probably will not meet your exacting

259
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,989
standards. The death of Jo Cox united

260
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,989
politicians in grief, and there will be tributes

261
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,989
to her from all sides But the paused referendum campaign

262
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,989
is getting back How will it be conducted over these

263
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,989
final few days? I'm joined now by the Labour

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,989
leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Before we start, you obviously knew

265
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,989
Tempra Ais a colleague. Any particular memories? -- Jo as a

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,989
colleague. She was passionate about Batley and spend. She grew up in

267
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,989
that area. I was there on Friday for a vigil. Biting memories in the

268
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,989
condolence book in the church. -- writing memories. They were totally

269
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,989
shocked and in grief for what happened. This was a murder of her

270
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,989
but it was also an attack on democracy and an attack on the right

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,989
of somebody to be represented to elect you and to go about their

272
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,989
business. We should also think for a moment of the two people who

273
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,989
intervened to try to help her. One of them is still in hospital, a

274
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,989
retired miner who tried to protect her. He will be out soon, we hope.

275
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,989
We have lost a great talent, someone who spoke up in Parliament for human

276
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,989
rights, peace in Syria and so many other places. People talk a lot of

277
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,989
the time about MPs. She was rooted in that place. She was one of

278
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,989
theirs. The whole point of democracy and involvement, when you elect

279
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,989
someone to a council, Member of Parliament but if you are to do your

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,989
job, you cannot leave the area of the people or the place that you

281
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,989
there. If we move our MPs into some sort of hermetically sealed

282
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,989
container where they are shipped from place to place, then we lose

283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,989
everything. I love my constituency. I love my community. What I love is

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,989
just walking about, chatting to people, many of whom I have known

285
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,989
for many years. That way you pick up the reality of legislation, the

286
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,989
reality in our case of austerity and the poverty that goes with it.

287
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,989
You're better informed to do your job. If you are in some kind of

288
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,989
security bubble, you very rapidly lose all of that and we have to

289
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,989
defend that and we have to defend people against this kind of

290
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,989
appalling attack that took place. It is not the first time. Other MPs

291
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,989
have been assaulted. Stephen Timms was assaulted, George Galloway was

292
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:21,989
assaulted. A number of others have been assaulted. Ian Gow was killed

293
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,989
in 1990. Were you aware of the growing worry of physical attacks?

294
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,989
The Shadow Leader of the house said he thought eventually somebody would

295
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,989
be killed. We have talked about this and the levels of security that MPs

296
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,989
need and want. There is a degree of fon ability. If you have an open

297
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,989
office and an open advice bureau, which is what we all want to do. We

298
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,989
want to see everyone, no matter how difficult their lives are. We do not

299
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,989
want to be cut off from them. At the same time we need security of some

300
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,989
sort to protect people. It is not just for MPs, it is for everyone.

301
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,989
MPs just protecting themselves is of course essential and important as

302
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,989
tragically the death of Jo showed. Everyone else needs to be protected

303
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,989
against any kind of attack, whatever the appalling motive might be behind

304
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,989
the attack. UN the Prime Minister were standing shoulder to shoulder.

305
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,989
-- you and the Prime Minister. When the House of Commons regroups

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,989
tomorrow, they have had comments that the parties should mingle and

307
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,989
sit on each other's benches. We are thinking about that. Tomorrow will

308
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,989
be a dignified occasion, not a time for lots of long speeches. It is

309
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,989
about all MPs standing together. An MP has died. It is an attack on all

310
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,989
of us. We have to reach out. Do you think the recent political

311
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,989
atmosphere, the referendum or anything else can has created a more

312
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,989
anti-MP mood? I do. I think MPs are perceived to be cut off. In reality,

313
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,989
most are not. Decision-making is seen to be cut off and the lives of

314
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,989
so many people, where they face housing problems, insecurity at

315
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,989
work, falling living standards, problems where children do not get

316
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,989
any housing, all of those issues to make people feel, hang on, what is

317
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,989
the political situation ever doing for me? Reducing working conditions

318
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,989
are making life more difficult for people creates a sense of anger and

319
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,989
insecurity. What is the answer? Is the answer to kick out all get

320
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,989
together and do something different? One thing that is going on, if we

321
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,989
vote to leave the EU, part of the story behind that will be lots and

322
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,989
lots of traditional Labour voters not listening to you or the party

323
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,989
leadership on immigration are going in the direction of Ukip on

324
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,989
immigration. Do you accept that in some sense the party has lost the

325
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,989
day of a lot of your traditional, white working-class constituents? We

326
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,989
have had several years of endless newspaper headlines blaming

327
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,989
everything on migration without ever being prepared to look at the

328
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,989
guarantee of the expectation of people in this country and across

329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,989
Europe. The Mike Ashley story, sports direct, Dennis Skinner made a

330
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,989
brilliant comment, when it was a pit, people from all over Europe

331
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,989
were working there as minors. The same conditions, the same housing,

332
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,989
the same union. Now there are several other people working on zero

333
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,989
hours contracts who have been shipped in from elsewhere. The

334
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,989
answer to that is not to blame them, the answer is, guess, at one level

335
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,989
to blame Mike Ashley but to blame the lack of regulation of working

336
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,989
conditions both here and in other parts of Europe. The workers

337
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,989
directive is very important. Do you think immigration should not be an

338
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,989
issue? There are a lot of people really, really worried about the

339
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,989
effects on school places, housing and public services and wage

340
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,989
compression. The reality is more than 2 million British people live

341
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,989
in Europe. Quite a lot of people from the European Union, mainly

342
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,989
Poland, have made their homes in Britain and are working, paying

343
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,989
taxes and all of that. The issues surely have to be to improve working

344
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,989
conditions, improved protection is all across Europe and look at those

345
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,989
who are making a great deal of money out of this exploitation. I mention

346
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,989
the posting of workers directive, it also about local wages and

347
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,989
conditions. If everybody had to be paid the relevant local rate, things

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,989
would be different. A number of people coming to the country would

349
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,989
probably be reduced. Do you think worries about immigration would

350
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,989
reduce? I do. There has to be the reintroduction of the migrant impact

351
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,989
fund which was introduced in 2008, which was a special payment that

352
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,989
will go to local authorities where there have been big changes. In the

353
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,989
same way that in the 1960s, the then Labour government introduced the

354
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,989
Commonwealth immigration fund for the same purpose. Some groups feel

355
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,989
they have been adversely affected. They will get more help for schools,

356
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,989
hospital places and so on. Absolutely. It brings people

357
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,989
together, to achieve a better society for all and recognise that

358
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,989
we have a lot of young people studying and working in Europe, we

359
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,989
have a lot of young Europeans working and studying here. People

360
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,989
move around. That actually is quite good all round. It gives people a

361
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,989
wide experience and actually helps to generate scientific research as

362
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,989
well as employment opportunities across the whole continent. Is there

363
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,989
an upper limit? I don't think you can have one while

364
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,989
you have the free movement of Labour. The free movement of Labour

365
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,989
means you have to balance the economy, so you have to improve

366
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,989
living standards and conditions. That means the European Union's

367
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,989
appalling treatment of Greece, particularly the European central

368
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,989
bank as well as the European Union, that is a problem. So if you

369
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,989
actually deliberately lower living standards and increase poverty in

370
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,989
certain countries in south-east or Eastern Europe, then you're bound to

371
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,989
have a flow of people looking for somewhere else to go. Surely the

372
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,989
issue is, an and your sturdy, an growth package right across Europe.

373
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,989
So you can call yourself unequivocally a pro-immigration

374
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,989
politician? Brendan Cox, whose wife was killed, has said that

375
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,989
politicians at the top have been far too feeble in making the case for

376
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,989
immigration. They have allowed the argument to be made by the far

377
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,989
right. I spoke to Brendan last night and we were talking about this whole

378
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,989
issue, that the far right have been allowed to grasp the agenda. Nigel

379
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,989
Farage for example puts up that appalling poster, which has a

380
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,989
picture of a lot of desperate he pulled fleeing from war, saying,

381
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,989
they are coming to threaten us. Hello jigger I think Williams called

382
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,989
it right this morning when he said, we have to play our part in dealing

383
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,989
with the refugee crisis, all of us. It is a humanitarian crisis. But

384
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,989
there are lots and lots and lots of people around this country who do

385
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,989
feel that immigration is a problem for them. They feel their community

386
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,989
is changing very quickly, they feel their identity is challenged. They

387
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,989
are not racists, not far right people, just people really worried

388
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,989
about immigration. They feel that people like you are not listening to

389
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,989
them. I am not calling them racists. What I am saying is, it is a failure

390
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,989
of our government not to fund local authorities, not to provide housing

391
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,989
for people, and for the first time in 25 in 30 years, attacking school

392
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,989
budgets. It is that which is the problem, and they should turn their

393
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,989
anger against this government and the austerity which has been put

394
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,989
forward by Cameron and Osborne over the past six years. Your deputy, Tom

395
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,989
Watson, has said there has to be an end put to the free movement of

396
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,989
people, there has to be limits on migration - do you agree with him?

397
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,989
Tom and I had a chat about this. All of us are agreed that there has to

398
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,989
be a greater equality of working conditions. There has to be the

399
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,989
prevention of undercutting. There has to be an end to the idea of a

400
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,989
race to the bottom in working conditions. At the end of the day,

401
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,989
workers working alongside each other should be treated the same and have

402
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,989
the same rights. They should be paid the same. They don't, at the moment.

403
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,989
There are people watching right now who say, here is someone who is in

404
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,989
favour of uncontrolled immigration - that terrifies me. Those people now

405
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,989
have no choice but to vote to leave the EU. There is no uncontrolled

406
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,989
immigration. There is free movement of people across the EU, which goes

407
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,989
both ways. More than 2 million British people are living in Europe.

408
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,989
It goes both ways. There's uncontrolled immigration from

409
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,989
outside Europe, and there has been certainly ever since the 1960s in

410
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,989
quite a severe form. I represent a very mixed constituency, where there

411
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,989
are great problems of getting family reunion, and there are not equal

412
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,989
rights for people coming from Europe. They do not get benefits

413
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,989
immediately, they do not get access to housing immediately. It is not

414
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,989
totally uncontrolled. But in terms of EU migration, there is no way of

415
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,989
a British Government controlling that, and therefore, people worried

416
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,989
about that should vote for Brexit, because that is the only answer? It

417
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,989
is the very principle of a single market across Europe, the free

418
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,989
movement of people. If you have the free movement of capital, you should

419
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,989
also have the free movement of people. What I should think is we

420
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,989
should turn our issues on austerity in this country and indeed the

421
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,989
generality of austerity across Europe. We should also turn our

422
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,989
attention on tax havens and tax avoidance, which has only latterly

423
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,989
begun to be dealt with by the European Union. Britain has a big

424
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,989
role in this because as ground dependent territories, we have quite

425
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,989
a lot of tax havens. People might come to your constituency and say,

426
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,989
Mr Corbyn, I am really worried about the sheer number of people coming

427
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,989
here. I am sorry you do not agree, but it worries me a lot. Those

428
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,989
people are now moving towards the Leave side of the argument. If we

429
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,989
leave as a country, it will be partly because lots and lots of

430
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,989
Labour voters outside the metropolis and outside Scotland and the rest of

431
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,989
England, vote Leave. If we leave as a country, exactly the same

432
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,989
arguments will be made - about housing, about jobs, about social

433
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,989
security. All of those issues will be exactly the same on Friday as

434
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,989
they are on Thursday. The only thing is, it's going to be very much more

435
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,989
difficult, because the trade arrangements with Europe are now

436
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,989
quite deeply embedded to keep very large number of jobs in Britain do

437
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,989
depend on exports to Europe. I do not believe in catastrophe

438
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,989
arguments, but I say people should think very, very carefully about the

439
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,989
direction in which we are going. If we want to have good conditions and

440
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,989
good social security for all of us, that means it has to be thought of

441
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,989
in this country, but also across Europe as a whole. And also, let's

442
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,989
not turn our back on the humanitarian crises which exist

443
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,989
around the world. I ask people to think very carefully on the very

444
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,989
wise words of Rowan Williams this morning. Thank you for talking to us

445
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,989
today. In a moment, I'll be

446
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,989
talking to Michael Gove. But first, with only four days to go

447
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,989
till voting in the EU referendum, details of a special

448
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,989
programme coming up. Join us from Wembley Arena,

449
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,989
where key figures will be debating the most

450
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,989
important issues And it will be in front

451
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,989
of a live audience of thousands in a final

452
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,989
attempt to persuade you of We've just heard from Jeremy Corbyn,

453
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,989
reflecting on the death of Jo Cox and what it means for the tone

454
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,989
of political debate in this country and for the security of MPs

455
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,989
as they go about their work. I'm joined now by the Justice

456
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,989
Secretary, Michael Gove. Welcome to you. As Justice

457
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,989
Secretary, and as a parliamentarian, what are your reflections on Jo Cox,

458
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,989
did you know her at all? I did not know her well but I was tortured

459
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,989
fortunate enough to meet her almost on her first week in the House of

460
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,989
Commons, when we were in the tearoom and had forgotten her cash so I lent

461
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,989
her a ?5 notes to get a cup of tea. Did you get it back? Absolutely. I

462
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,989
struck up a conversation with her at the time, and had a few subsequent

463
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,989
conversations, and as so many people who knew how far better than me have

464
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,989
said, she is an amazing and wonderful person. She was a very

465
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,989
vivid parliamentarian. Yet she spoke with great passion and

466
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,989
effectiveness, she campaigned for causes she believed in with a great

467
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,989
heart. And I think she was the sort of person who all of us would want

468
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,989
our daughters to grow up to be like. She was an amazing person. I can

469
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,989
only grieve for her and in particular think of her poor

470
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,989
children and her Brive is burned, and I know the thoughts and prayers

471
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,989
of many of us at this time are with them. What is your view on the

472
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,989
debate we have been talking about on this programme about security for

473
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,989
MPs? I know all of you want to be out there on the front line, but

474
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,989
there is an issue now. A lot of female MPs in particular have become

475
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,989
worried about physical threats, rape threats, made against them regularly

476
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,989
on social media. People listen to these threats, and sometimes,

477
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,989
tragically, they act on them. You're right. Female colleagues in

478
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,989
particular have been subjected to the most horrendous abuse on social

479
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,989
media outlets like Twitter. I am thinking of Lucy, the incredibly

480
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,989
impressive and brave Labour MP who has faced horrendous anti-Semitic

481
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,989
abuse. Stella Creasy, again, a great camp pain, and my colleague Nicky

482
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,989
Morgan, who has also been on the receiving end. I think we need to

483
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,989
take a step back and think what we can do in order to make sure that

484
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,989
people in the public eye are kept safe. But I say two other things. It

485
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,989
is really important that members of Parliament remain accessible, as

486
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,989
Nicholas Soames and Kate Hoey said earlier. We are public servants. We

487
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,989
are there to be in touch and to reflect what our voters want us to

488
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,989
argue for. And therefore I think we must not try to need seal MPs away

489
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,989
from people whom we serve and one other thing - there are other public

490
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,989
servants who run daily risks, and as Justice Secretary, I think of prison

491
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,989
officers, those who work in the court system and police officers as

492
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,989
well. While I have been Justice Secretary, there have been

493
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,989
horrendous assaults against prison officers, and of course there has

494
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,989
been the murder of a police officer as well on, where side. So don't

495
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,989
forget them. -- on Merseyside. There are so many dedicated public

496
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,989
servants whose hard work we need to honour and whose safety needs to be

497
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,989
in the forefront of our mind. Sir Nicholas Soames said that the tone

498
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,989
of the political debate in this country has become more and more

499
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,989
aggressive and perhaps excessive as well. In the course of this

500
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,989
referendum debate, we all want robust arguments, but it has become

501
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,989
a little bit over the top, has it not worry people on both sides have

502
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,989
been pointing the finger, accusing each other of being traitors and

503
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,989
lying and all the rest of it - has it been too aggressive? Of course,

504
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,989
there have been moments when individuals have said things which I

505
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,989
certainly would not endorse. But I am very strongly in favour of free

506
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,989
speech. I think one of the things which is central to a healthy

507
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,989
democracy is the belief that people can express themselves and expressed

508
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,989
deep feelings with passion and force. One of the things not just

509
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,989
about this referendum campaign, but election campaigns as well, is that

510
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,989
people need to hear the arguments laid out, and the Advocate should

511
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,989
begin an affair run. I certainly think that there have been people on

512
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,989
the Remain side and on the Leave side who have made powerful,

513
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,989
impressive and passionate arguments. When we think about what is precious

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,989
in our democracy, and it is our democracy which we will be voting to

515
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,989
decide on, on Thursday, when we think about what is precious, then

516
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,989
free speech, robust debate, that is at the heart of our democracy. And

517
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,989
you don't think it has gone too far? Sadiq Khan, who knows a thing or two

518
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,989
about robust debate, has been talking about a climate of hatred,

519
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,989
negativity and cynicism. First of all, I admire Sadiq Khan, I think he

520
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,989
is proving to be, in his first few weeks, a good Mayor of London. I

521
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,989
entirely understand, after having been through a male role campaign,

522
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,989
why he will reflect on politics in that way. But I take a slightly

523
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,989
different view. -- a mayoral campaign. Instead of commentating on

524
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,989
the campaign, it is the responsibility of people like myself

525
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,989
in any campaign to make arguments. I entirely respect the right of

526
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,989
commentators like yourself and others, to draw conclusions and to

527
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,989
mark our homework, as it were. But I don't think we politicians should

528
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,989
mark our own homework. It is important for us to outline what we

529
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,989
believe and then let the people make a judgment. I don't think I would

530
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,989
dare module homework, Michael Gove. I know it was not your poster, but

531
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,989
that famous poster which went out a couple of days ago, from the Ukip

532
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,989
side of the Leave campaign, which had a big crowd of migrants, most of

533
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,989
them brown skinned, and it just said, breaking point - what do you

534
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,989
think about that kind of rhetoric? When I saw that poster, I shuddered.

535
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,989
I thought it was the one thing to do. Again, I must stress, I believe

536
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,989
in free speech. I don't want to deny anyone a platform. When I have had

537
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,989
the opportunity to talk about migration during the course of this

538
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,989
debate, I hope I have been very clear. I am pro-migration, but I

539
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,989
believe that the way in which we secure public support for the

540
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,989
continued benefits which migration brings, and the way we secure public

541
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,989
support for helping refugees in need, is if people feel that they

542
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,989
can control the overall numbers coming here. In Canada and

543
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,989
Australia, they have control, and therefore they are able both to

544
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,989
welcome economic migrants and refugees. I understand that. Let me

545
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,989
look to you what the statement said on Turkey. Since the birth rate in

546
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,989
Turkey is so high, we can expect to see an additional million people

547
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,989
from Turkey alone in the EU within eight years. Crime is far higher,

548
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,989
and so far... It sounds a bit like, those people are the threats. Are

549
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,989
you happy with the tone of that? Yes, because I think it is important

550
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,989
to stress that when we are thinking about the enlargement of the

551
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,989
European Union, it is the official European Union policy to accelerate

552
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,989
Turkey's accession to the EU. And a number of politicians, including

553
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,989
Theresa May, have said that at the moment they do not think that is

554
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,989
right. In particular, I have pointed out that the Turkish president has

555
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,989
been taking his country in a direction which I do not think is

556
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,989
progressive. All absolutely true. But within eight years? The Prime

557
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,989
Minister says Turkey would not be a member of the EU until the year

558
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:19,989
3000. The fact that the British government

559
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,989
wants Turkey to join is clear. The rate and speed will depend on a

560
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,989
bright era of political factors but it is the case that during the

561
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,989
course of this year the European Union has said it wants to

562
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,989
accelerate that process. When Turkey is becoming less democratic, that is

563
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,989
not the right thing to do. Does the talk of birth rates make you a

564
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,989
little queasy? It is important to take into account numbers overall.

565
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,989
The important thing is we benefit from migration. If the numbers are

566
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,989
controlled. We know that when Romania and Bulgaria joined the

567
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,989
European Union, there were predictions on either side about the

568
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,989
numbers that would come. Those people at the higher end of the

569
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,989
estimates were correct. It puts a strain on public services and it is

570
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,989
important when we're thinking about migration to look at numbers and to

571
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,989
make sure there is a balanced approach. Michael Heseltine said,

572
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,989
the Brexit case depends on fanning fears about immigration. I am amazed

573
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:41,989
that someone like you marches to the drum of my Farage, Donald Trump and

574
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,989
Le Pen. I think our campaign, which I must stress is cross-party, and

575
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,989
has the support of people like Frank Field and Kate Hoey from the Labour

576
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,989
Party people like David Owen, an Independent Democrat. It has been

577
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,989
characterised by the breakfast of voices. It is not the people who

578
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,989
have been leading the league campaign. It has been people like

579
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,989
Kate, Frank, David Owen and myself and Boris Johnson, who are not cut

580
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,989
from the cloth that Michael refers to. Let's move on to the economic

581
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,989
side of the argument. What will happen is inevitably some kind of a

582
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,989
gamble. Even if you say that the Treasury warnings are far too

583
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,989
extreme and some of the stuff we have heard about economic Armageddon

584
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,989
are going way, way over the top. Going from where we are now to a new

585
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,989
place does involve a job. We have talked about bumps in the road.

586
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:53,989
Michael Howard has said he does not worry about that. Surely you have to

587
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,989
accept it is a gamble we will be taking if people vote to leave. I

588
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,989
would not use the word gamble but I want to be absolutely clear about

589
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,989
this. Whichever way we vote, there are risks to our future and

590
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,989
challenges in the global economy. My view is the risks will be less and

591
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,989
the challenges will be easier to need if we vote to leave because we

592
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,989
will have control of the economic levers, the money we centred

593
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,989
European Union, the control over our laws. As a result will be able to

594
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,989
deal with whatever the world throws at us because people making

595
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,989
decisions on our behalf are emotionally invested in our future,

596
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,989
not people in Brussels and Strasbourg who are making decisions

597
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,989
based on factors. Millions of people are looking for unimpeachable

598
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,989
authority. If you work for Hitachi, who have said they will look again

599
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,989
at investment in this country or Rolls-Royce same thing, or John

600
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,989
Lewis, or JP Morgan, who are threatening jobs. They will listened

601
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,989
to their own bosses and rightly so full that they know about their own

602
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,989
industries. What is striking is there are so many bosses and

603
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,989
corporate leaders who have said, whatever happens they will continue

604
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,989
to invest in this country because the educational achievements, the

605
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,989
generosity of spirit, the hard work and creative genius of the British

606
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,989
people makes them believe in this country. More than that, there have

607
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:35,989
been a number of very important business people, James Dyson and

608
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,989
Bamford, for example. He and Anthony Bamford and Simon Wells, all of them

609
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,989
are very clear we would be better off if we left the European Union.

610
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,989
If you would not use the word gamble about taking the choice to leave, it

611
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,989
is a big, big change. What word would you leave? What it would be

612
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,989
would be an affirmation of faith and hope in Britain. I think Britain

613
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,989
will be taking its place alongside countries like Australia, Canada,

614
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,989
New Zealand and America as a self-governing democracy. Democracy

615
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,989
is one of the great gifts we gave the world. Other countries which

616
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,989
emulated our approach have prospered and that is a wonderful thing. I

617
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,989
think if we voted to leave, what we would be doing is saying the British

618
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,989
people, in their wisdom and generosity, have the ability to not

619
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,989
just govern themselves well but to be a progressive beacon to the

620
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,989
world. You mentioned Australia. The points system on immigration looks

621
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,989
like a very detailed manifesto to be handed to whoever is Prime Minister

622
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,989
after the result from the referendum. Is that on the ballot

623
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,989
paper? You have made various promises and listed bills with

624
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,989
European law, the Special Finance Bill, it looks like a manifesto. It

625
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,989
is a clear outline of the things we could achieve and we voted to leave.

626
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,989
Everything we have talked about, our policies we could embark on, they

627
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,989
are changes we could make which would benefit this country. If we

628
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,989
voted to leave, one thing is BLT on domestic fuel. We cannot remove VAT.

629
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,989
-- VAT. It would be a good thing and help the very poorest in society. Is

630
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,989
this on the ballot paper? People voting to leave the EU should know

631
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,989
this can only happen if we vote to leave. Do go to David Cameron

632
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,989
saying, here are the things you must do? I would say, now we have left

633
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,989
the European Union and there has been a clear vote, an instruction

634
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,989
from the electorate to us as a team to implement it, now is the time for

635
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,989
us to implement these proposals and give people both the tax reduction

636
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,989
that they hoped and believed we could receive only outside the

637
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,989
European Union and also the boost to the National Health Service. He

638
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,989
believes that leaving the single market will put a bomb under the

639
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,989
economy and does not believe in the Australian points system and so

640
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,989
forth. If he stayed on as Prime Minister, would he not simply be a

641
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,989
hostage Prime Minister, a puppet Prime Minister, doing what he is

642
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,989
told by the Brexiteers and the Tory Party? A humiliation for him.

643
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,989
Absolutely not. One thing about the Prime Minister if he is a Democrat

644
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,989
Patriot. When we had a vote in the House of Commons of intervention in

645
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,989
Syria in the last parliament, the vote went against the Prime Minister

646
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,989
and in what I believed. As a Democrat and patriot, he respected

647
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,989
that vote and then sought to follow the instructions the House of

648
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,989
Commons had given. On this occasion, the Prime Minister, if we vote to

649
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,989
leave, I know he will respect that instruction. We were elected on a

650
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,989
manifesto of which the referendum was part. There are also reforms of

651
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,989
the education system and the National Health Service which is at

652
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,989
the heart of what David Cameron wants to guarantee. I am 100% behind

653
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,989
all of that. What about the comparison budget that George

654
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,989
Osborne came up with? How can he have authority as Chancellor? I did

655
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,989
not say I thought the situation would arise. George has been an

656
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,989
outstanding Chancellor and he has rescued our economy from the

657
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,989
difficult circumstances we inherited in 2010. During the course of the

658
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,989
campaign, different sides, the Remains side, will make political

659
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,989
interventions. I disagree with that political intervention. It does not

660
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,989
in any way remove my admiration and respect for him. You could not sit

661
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:26,989
inside a cabinet and vote down what the Chancellor has said. -- Cabinet.

662
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,989
The argument that was made, on the basis of a speculative report, the

663
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,989
country might lose a significant amount of money if we were to leave,

664
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,989
I think that speculative report was wrong, our economy would be stronger

665
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,989
if we voted to leave the European Union and the situation does not

666
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,989
arise. A leading Tory donor said, business has lost trust in the

667
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,989
Chancellor because of the big manipulation of figures in the

668
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,989
referendum and a very strange arguments were so aggressive and

669
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,989
without proper evidence about what would happen will be to leave the

670
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,989
EU. For political union of the party, we need to think about the

671
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,989
new Chancellor. I completely disagree with that. I am a

672
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,989
free-speech guy. I respect the right people to put their cards on the

673
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,989
table. I think our economy is stronger with George Osborne as

674
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,989
Chancellor and I think our economy would be stronger if we voted to

675
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,989
leave. We would be able to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on

676
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,989
our priorities, like the NHS. Final quote from John Major. On the NHS,

677
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:39,989
it is like a small hamster. You are a hungry pipe and a new cannot be

678
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,989
trusted with the NHS. -- Tyson. I have enormous respect for the

679
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,989
National Health Service and for him. But first, a look at what's coming

680
00:55:49,000 --> 00:56:01,989
up after this programme. We talk about the legacy of Jo Cox.

681
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,989
The reaction to the Church of England is praying for health. As

682
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,989
Tim Peake returns to Earth, we are asking, should we spend more on

683
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,989
space? Join us at 10am, if you can. We're nearly out of

684
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,989
time for this morning. On The Sunday Politics in an hour,

685
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,989
Andrew Neil will be talking to the former Liberal Democrat

686
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,989
leader Lord Ashdown. I'll also be talking

687
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,989
to the actress Helen McCrory, and no doubt some

688
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,989
political guests, too. But we leave you now with the young

689
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,989
singer and songwriter Jake Bugg. From his brand new album,

690
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,989
On My One, this is Love, # Crying for the one

691
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:52,989
who doesn't love you # You don't know why

692
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,989
he doesn't want you # So dry those eyes

693
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,989
and don't be afraid # Crying for the one

694
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,989
who doesn't love you # You don't know why

695
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,989
he doesn't want you # So dry those eyes

696
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,989
and don't be afraid # Cause the rhythm of

697
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,989
lovers ain't the same # No, you don't know it don't

698
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,989
come easy, come easy # I'm the first to have gone

699
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:34,989
and tell me if I'm wrong # I hope that I am

700
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:48,989
and you don't hate me # And I know, and I know

701
00:57:49,000 --> 00:58:01,989
that you must hate me # Holding back the reasons

702
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,989
not to love you # But when you're

703
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,989
feeling down and lonely # So dry those eyes

704
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:24,989
and don't be afraid # Cause the rhythm of

705
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,989
lovers ain't the same # No, you don't know

706
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,989
it don't come easy # I'm the first to have gone

707
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:45,989
and tell me if I'm wrong # I hope that I am

708
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,989
and you don't hate me # And I know, and I

709
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:03,000
know, and I know that
