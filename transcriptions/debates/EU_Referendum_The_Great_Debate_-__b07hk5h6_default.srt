1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,989
Good evening. APPLAUSE

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,989
Good evening and welcome to Wembley and the great debate, voting now

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,989
only one day away in the most important decision the United

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,989
Kingdom has been asked to make in a generation. And here in the SSE

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,989
Arena several thousand voters divided equally between supporters

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,989
of Leave and Remain have come together to listen to the final

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,989
appeals of each side. All the main speakers here on stage were

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,989
nominated by the designated campaigns. Speaking in favour of

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,989
leaving are the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the Labour

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,989
MP... APPLAUSE

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,989
The Labour MP Gisela Stuart and the Conservative Energy Minister an

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,989
threea Ledson. APPLAUSE

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,989
Speaking in favourite of remaining in the European Union, the leader of

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,989
the Conservative Party in Scotland, Ruth Davidson. The Mayor of London,

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,989
Sadiq Khan. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,989
And Francis O'Grady, General Secretary of the TUC. Also with us

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,989
here in the arena, at the other end of the arena is Mishal Husain with

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,989
other guests, who are going to be listening to what's being said up

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,989
here and commenting on. It Yes, I'll get reaction from my panel of

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,989
guests, representing Leave and Remain, business people, politicians

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,989
and others, who've played a part in the referendum campaign. I'm in the

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,989
media spin room, where we'll be getting instant reaction to the

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,989
debate from political campaigners and from the press and fact checking

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,989
with the BBC's reality check team. And if you want to take part from

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,989
home in the debate on social media, you can use the hashtag BBC debate,

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,989
go to BBC News, on Facebook, where you can post your questions and

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,989
comments. There's also an instant fact checking on our website,

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,989
bbc.co.uk/realitycheck. Now a few moments ago the two sides drew lots

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,989
to decide who would start the debate. The Leave side won and

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,989
they've chosen Gisela Stuart, briefly, to summarise their

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,989
argument. APPLAUSE

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,989
Ask yourself just one question, if we were not in the EU today would we

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,989
join it? And if the answer is no, then on Thursday you will vote Leave

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,989
and take control. The European Union was a noble dream in the last

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,989
century, but today, it has failed. It has turned into a nightmare. I'm

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,989
a mother and I'm a grandmother and I think it is terrible that 50% of

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,989
young people in Greece don't have a job. The only continent with a

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,989
growth rate lower than Europe is Antarctica. By being in the EU, we

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,989
lose control of billions of pounds every year. It doesn't have to be

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,989
like this. We can take back control over our laws. We can take back

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,989
control over our taxes. We can take back control over our borders,

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,989
immigration policy and security. You know, sometimes voting doesn't make

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,989
much difference. On Thursday, it really does. You will decide who

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,989
makes decisions about the future of this country, so, take back control

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:42,989
and vote Leave. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,989
Thank you. Now to open the debate for the Remain side, their choice,

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,989
Sadiq Khan. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,989
Good evening. In just two days' time, we will make the most

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,989
important decision for a generation. Tonight, Ruth, Francis and I will

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,989
set out the positive and patriotic choice to remain in Europe. You and

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,989
your family will be both better off and safer. Your job will be more

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,989
secure and your wages will be higher. The prices you pay in the

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,989
shops will be lower and your rights at work will be protected. As a

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,989
lawyer, I learned to listen to the experts and follow the evidence.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,989
Well, the evidence is undeniable and all the experts agree - we are

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,989
stronger, safer and better off in Europe, even those who want us to

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,989
leave admit that it's a big gamble. If there's one thing you should

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,989
remember when you go to vote, it's this: If we as a country decide to

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,989
quit, then we're out for good. There's no going back. Being

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,989
outwards and looking and forming alliances makes our country so

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,989
great. I urge you to make the positive and patriotic choice and

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,989
vote Remain. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,989
Thank you. Now the questions that we've picked for debate tonight come

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,989
from our huge audience, obviously they can't all ask a question. But

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,989
we've divided the questions up into three sections - the economy,

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,989
immigration and Britain's place in the world. The key issues, those

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,989
three key issues are what we're doing. First, before we go to the

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,989
questions, we want to give you an objective view of the issues that

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,989
are at stake. Let's have a look at the issues that both sides have

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,989
identified on the economy. The UK economy is the fifth largest

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,989
in the world and the second largest in the European Union, after

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,989
Germany. Exports to countries in the EU account for 44% of everything we

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,989
sell abroad. Last year, we exported goods and services worth ?223

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,989
billion to the EU, and ?288 billion to the rest of the world. Imports

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,989
from the EU amounted to ?291 billion, which means we have a trade

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,989
deficit of ?68 billion a year with the EU. All this trade takes place

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,989
within the EU's single market. That means there are no tariffs on goods

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,989
moving between EU countries. Leave campaigners say that would also be

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,989
possible under future trade deals, if we vote to leave. The single

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,989
market means a common set of rules and standards for almost all goods

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,989
and many services, rules that are enforced by the European Court of

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,989
Justice. Remain supporters say that makes it harder for other countries

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,989
to discriminate against British companies and that being in the

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,989
single market is good for jobs. Leave supporters say it means all

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,989
British firms are bound by EU regulations which add unnecessary

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,989
red tape and are often imposed without UK support. So when it comes

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,989
to the economy, which is the best path for Britain - to Remain or to

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,989
Leave? So let's go to our first question,

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,989
which is from a Leave supporter. I run a small business, employing

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,989
ten local staff, and have been stifled by the raft of EU

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,989
legislation that's been imposed on me. What benefits are there for

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,989
small business owners of remaining in the EU, as I can't see any? Ruth

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,989
Davidson. Thank you, Maxine. Small businesses are the backbone of our

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,989
economy. I know that some people can find the EU a bit frustrating and

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,989
fussy, but what it does, it provides a level playing field, so that you

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,989
can't be undercut by other companies in other parts of the world. That's

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,989
why eight out of ten of the CBI's small business members want to stay

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,989
in the EU. We also help to write those rules. If we came out of the

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,989
EU, we wouldn't have a seat at the table. If we wanted to trade in the

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,989
EU, the other countries could put on tariffs and taxes, so you couldn't

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,989
sell to all of these other nations, the biggest free trading block in

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,989
the world, for free. It would cost us more money. That would hurt our

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,989
economy. It would also hurt jobs in this country. I want our economy to

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,989
grow and not shrink. The other side haven't told us what would replace

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,989
the single market. They haven't told us how many jobs would be lost. They

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,989
haven't told us how long new trade deals will take. They haven't told

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,989
us how big the hit will be. I don't think that's good enough when you go

108
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,989
to vote. You have to know or don't go, vote to remain to the biggest

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,989
trade deal that we can get in the world. All right.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,989
APPLAUSE I'm going to try to give equal time

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,989
to both sides tonight. Boris. Thank you very much. I must say that I

112
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,989
think it was extraordinary to hear that we would have tariffs imposed

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,989
on us, because everybody knows that this country receives about a fifth

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,989
of Germany's entire car manufacturing output, 820,000

115
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,989
vehicles a year. Do you seriously suppose that they are going to be so

116
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,989
insane, as to allow tariffs to be imposed between Britain and Germany?

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,989
CHEERING I've been listening to businesses large and small, up and

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,989
down our country, over the last few months. I've been amazed how many

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,989
passionately want to come out of the single market, because of the rules

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,989
and regulation that's it imposes. 100% of UK businesses, even though

121
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,989
only 6% only do any trade with the rest of the EU. I'm listening to

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,989
some of the most extraordinary success stories of UK manufacturing

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,989
- JCB, the makers of the fantastic diggers that are building this city,

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,989
building roads and cities around the world. They want to come out of the

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,989
EU and not just JCD, but James Dyson, the single biggest

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,989
manufacturer of vacuum cleaners in Germany! All right, Boris. He wants

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,989
to come out. Just let me finish this point. He's telling the papers

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,989
tonight that he thinks staying in would be an act of economic

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,989
self-harm. All right. The way to more wealth and more jobs is to

130
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,989
leave, vote leave. Take control on Thursday. Sadiq Khan. I'm pleased

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,989
you're speaking to people, Boris, and I hope you're listening to. One

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,989
of the people you're listening to is a chap called Patrick Minford, he's

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,989
your chief economic advisor. Now Patrick said and I quote, "Leaving

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,989
will eliminate manufacturing. Over time, if we left the EU, it seems

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,989
likely we would most likely eliminate manufacturing, but this

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,989
shouldn't scare us." Let me tell you, to those 2. 5 million who work

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,989
in manufacturing, it scares them. It scares their family and it scares

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,989
me. Thank you. Well I ran financial services businesses for 25 years. I

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,989
did a tint as City minister and I'm a mum. I genuinely believe our

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,989
future will be so much brighter if we vote Leave and take back control

141
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,989
of our trade. The European Union has been a disaster for UK trade with

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,989
the rest of the world. It is true to say if we remain in, we're already

143
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,989
one of the biggest contributors to the EU, their failed euro project is

144
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,989
going to cost us so dearly. We will be paying for it forever. Not only

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,989
that, the EU wants to expand its borders to include Turkey and we

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,989
simply cannot afford it. We need to take back control and vote Leave on

147
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,989
Thursday. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

148
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,989
Francis, just a reminder, Maxine's question was what benefits there are

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,989
for small business owners. I was going to say that Maxine, your

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,989
question is about small businesses and there are lots of small

151
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,989
businesses in Britain that have a pretty tough time, but many of them

152
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,989
are also parts of supply chains. The Leave side roll out JCB, but that's

153
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,989
one company. All the experts are saying that the economy would take a

154
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,989
big hit if we came out of the EU, that we trade -- trade would be more

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,989
hit as well. If you don't believe the experts, then listen to the shop

156
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,989
floor, because I'm here representing workers tonight. Union reps from

157
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,989
BMW, Toyota, Ford, Nissan, you name is, across the manufacturing sector,

158
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,989
they are saying we cannot afford this gamble with our jobs, our

159
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,989
wages, our livelihoods and our rights.

160
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,989
Gisela. Maxine, as someone who run as small business you know you don't

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,989
have time to lobby in Brussels. That's why the big companies like

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,989
Brussels, because they are all just lobbying to have their rules

163
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,989
imposed. APPLAUSE. And you are left with

164
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,989
having to comply with them. What I find is where the real job

165
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,989
generators are the small businesses like yours. Let's say what will

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,989
happen after we vote to leave. The income payments, the chair of the In

167
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,989
campaign, Sir Stuart Rose of M, said it is not going to be a step

168
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,989
change or somebody is going to turn the lights out. And then very

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,989
importantly, he said wages will go up. That should be something that is

170
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,989
really very important, because the pressure at the same time of

171
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,989
uncontrolled immigration, which is what the Bank of England has said,

172
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,989
that with every 10% you've got a suppression of 2% on wages. So for

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,989
small businesses you are better off, take back control and leave.

174
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,989
APPLAUSE. Do you want to come back on that? I do. Let's be honest,

175
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,989
workers in this country have already been through a rough time. That was

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,989
nothing to do with this debate. That was to do with all those bankers who

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,989
crashed our economy. And workers ended up paying the price. So when

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,989
we talk about wages, the TUC has looked at all the hard evidence.

179
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,989
What it shows, what we can see is that in the long run, because our

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,989
economy would be hit, good jobs like the ones in BMW and the car

181
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,989
factories would be replaced by worse ones like Sports Direct and zero

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:47,989
hours, and Wetherspoons for that matter. Alright. Wages would drop in

183
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,989
the long run by ?38 a week. That's filling up your petrol tank in a

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,989
small car. That's a big hit and we can't afford it. Don't take the

185
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,989
risk. Andrea? Thank you. Frances, what Len McCluskey, the boss of

186
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,989
Unite union, the biggest union, has said is that in the last ten years,

187
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,989
the EU's accession plans have created gigantic experiment at the

188
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,989
expense of ordinary workers. The result has been sustained pressure

189
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,989
on living standards, a systemic attempt to hold down wages and to

190
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,989
cut costs of social provision for working people. The EU has also

191
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,989
created 50% youth unemployment right across southern Europe. It's a total

192
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,989
(Inaudible) for a generation of young people. Andrea, we are talking

193
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,989
about British jobs and we have the highest level of employment in our

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,989
country's history. If you want to trade quotes, let's talk about what

195
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,989
your side have been saying. Boris Johnson, his Chief Economist says it

196
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,989
will eliminate manufacturing. He also said the EU would generate an

197
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,989
economic shock. Michael Gove says it will mean inevitably bumps in the

198
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,989
road. He said he can't guarantee that people won't lose their jobs. I

199
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,989
cannot question that every person currently in work in their current

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,989
job will keep their job. Boris Johnson said, will there be job

201
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,989
losses, there might or there might not. That is not good enough. That

202
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,989
is not good enough. CHEERING. It hasn't taken them long.

203
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,989
Boris? It hasn't taken them long... Hold on. They told us they would

204
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,989
have a positive and patriotic case and they are back to Project Fear

205
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,989
within moments. CHEERING. I want to protect British

206
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,989
workers. It is positive. They have nothing positive to say. I want

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,989
to... Hold on. Lord rose... Everybody will have their chance,

208
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,989
but if you speak one at a time, everybody here can hear and

209
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,989
everybody at home can hear. Boris. Thank you. It was Lord Rose who said

210
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,989
clearly that there would be no shock, that things would go on as

211
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,989
they are. Except for one thing. He said people on low incomes, as

212
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,989
Gisela rightly said, would get a pay rise. He was supported in that view

213
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,989
by somebody on the panel opposite. It is no less a figure, I will leave

214
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,989
you to guess. Somebody said that in too many places immigration has

215
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,989
driven down local wages. Now, who do you think that was on the panel

216
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,989
opposite? It was Sadiq Khan. I think he was making a good point.

217
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,989
APPLAUSE. No I didn't, Boris. As a Conservative, and I'm a proud

218
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,989
Conservative and a believer in free markets, the differentials in

219
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,989
incomes in our country have become too great. It is wrong that FTSE 100

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,989
chiefs are earning 150 times the average pay of people on the shop

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,989
floor. It would be a fine thing if as Lord Rose said people on low

222
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,989
incomes got a pay rise as a result of us taking back control of our

223
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,989
country and our system. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Boris, can I

224
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,989
ask you a question? I don't think it is unreasonable that people are

225
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,989
worried about their local hospital, worried about their local school,

226
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,989
worried what would happen if our economy went into recession or if

227
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,989
they lost their jobs or business struggles. All the experts say, and

228
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,989
you know this, leaving the EU would cause problems from our country.

229
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,989
Most recently as today, the chap who predicted the crash in 2008, what

230
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,989
did he say, Boris? He said Brexit could stall the UK economy and tip

231
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,989
us into recession. It is not unreasonable for a mum and dad

232
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,989
worried about paying the bills to ask the question, what is your plan?

233
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,989
A slogan is not a detailed plan. We want an answer to the question, what

234
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,989
is your plan? How would you make sure the terms of trade with the EU

235
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,989
are better than they are now? How would you make sure jobs won't

236
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,989
suffer? How would you make sure small businesses won't suffer? The

237
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,989
last time there was a recession, hard-working people in this country

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,989
suffered, many lost their homes. What's important, Boris, you ask the

239
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,989
question, but what is your plan? APPLAUSE. The point is, we are as

240
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,989
things stand spending billions every year that go into a big black hole

241
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,989
in the European Union and it's going to get worse. All the Remain side

242
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,989
have to talk about is Project Fear. We are the fifth biggest economy in

243
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,989
the world. We will be able to have free trade once we are free of the

244
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,989
European Union that has done a terrible job negotiating free trade

245
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,989
for us. Even Switzerland and Singapore, far smaller economies,

246
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,989
have been able to negotiate more than five times the value of the

247
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,989
free trade of the European Union. APPLAUSE. Vote to leave on Thursday.

248
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,989
We have a second question. It is on the economy and it is from Miranda,

249
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,989
who is supporting Remain. As a black British woman, I am grateful for the

250
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,989
protections the EU has provided me in the workplace and in wider

251
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,989
society. If we leave the EU, will this be the beginning of a slippery

252
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,989
slope towards weaker employment and social rights in the UK?

253
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,989
APPLAUSE. Andrea? Thank you very much for your question. The truth is

254
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,989
that UK governments have led the way in providing good rights for

255
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,989
workers, even before the European Union came into existence we had

256
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,989
equal pay legislation. It's been... Governments of all parties have

257
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,989
created minimum wage legislation, now a National Living Wage, shared

258
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,989
parental lead, ad, child-free tax care -- tax-free childcare. It is

259
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,989
this country that is protecting workers' rights. We do not need an

260
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,989
unelected bureaucratic European leaders who none of us can even

261
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,989
name, let alone who any of us voted for, to tell us what our workers'

262
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,989
rights can be. We should take back control and look after our own

263
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,989
society. APPLAUSE. It is a question about

264
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,989
employment and social rights. Do you want to start? It is a really

265
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,989
important question from Miranda, because too often we hear the words

266
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,989
red tape and what they are really talking about is getting rid of

267
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,989
vital rights at work that we all rely on.

268
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,989
APPLAUSE. Now, these rights weren't gifted to us. We fought over

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,989
generations, over boted to us. We fought over generations, over

270
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,989
borders, trade unions - all of us fought author these rights. But the

271
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,989
EU guarantees them. These are really important to our real lives. People

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,989
don't always understand this. This about if your child is sick, getting

273
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,989
emergency leave to look after them. Them. It is about equal rights for

274
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,989
part timers and agency workers. We hear a lot about holidays, when the

275
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,989
working time directive came in, 2 million people in Britain got paid

276
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,989
holidays for the first time. Mainly women, mainly young people. Do you

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,989
trust them, can they promise us today, because I've heard a lot from

278
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,989
some of these leading lights in the Leave campaign and what they plan to

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,989
do on employment rights, can you promise us today that you will

280
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,989
protect each and every single right that we won through the EU? Alright,

281
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,989
that's the question. Gisela. We have done already. Already. I first

282
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,989
joined the trade union 45 years ago when I was an apprentice and I

283
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,989
though that strong trade unions, are best supported by Labour

284
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,989
Governments, protect rights. I find it extraordinary that I'm being told

285
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,989
that I can't trust you, the voter, to make sure we get a Government in

286
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,989
which protects workers' rights and we need Brussels to defend you.

287
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,989
APPLAUSE. The euro is a broken project. We are going to pay... No,

288
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,989
YOU are going to pay out of your taxes one bail-out after another.

289
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,989
And the European Union does not protect your jobs. Just a few years

290
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,989
ago, ford Transit got money from the European Union so they could take

291
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,989
their factory out of the United Kingdom and put it into Turkey. That

292
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,989
is wrong. APPLAUSE. Sadiq Khan. Miranda, I

293
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,989
would ask you a question, but Gisela, you are so wrong. Every time

294
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,989
we've been... Every time you and I have been in a lobby voting for

295
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,989
bills to give workers' rights, they've been in the other lobby

296
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,989
voting against those rights. APPLAUSE. Let me say this. Let me

297
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,989
tell you why you're wrong. Because Priti Patel let the mask slip. She

298
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,989
has said, if we could just halve the burdens of the EU social and

299
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,989
employment legislation, and let me tell you what that means. That means

300
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,989
rights for mums and dads. That means rights for part time workers who've

301
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,989
the same rights as full-time workers. Web the employer changes

302
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,989
ownership, they have rights. The worst thing for workers is their

303
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,989
bosses business going out of business. Them losing trade, losing

304
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,989
jobs. That's why we need a healthy economy. Gisela, you should know

305
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,989
better. APPLAUSE. Sadiq, the most important

306
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,989
worker's right is a right to a job. As long as we are shackled to a

307
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,989
failing eurozone liable to bail-out after bail-out, we will not succeed.

308
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,989
There's two points. Number one, the eurozone is growing faster than our

309
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,989
economy and the USA. Number two... You and I both fought an election

310
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,989
where these guys were boasting how brilliant our economy is, right?

311
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,989
They were boasting last year how brilliant our economy is. One of the

312
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,989
reasons why we are the fifth richest country is our role is enhanced by

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,989
being in the European Union. We are at the table helping the rules being

314
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,989
made. APPLAUSE. . Boris? In addition, it

315
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,989
beggars belief that the Remain side cannot think of a single one of the

316
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,989
EU's multitude of regulations they would get rid of, not even the

317
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,989
clinical trials directive, which prevents vital pharmaceutical work

318
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,989
being carried out. The EU I'm afraid is a job-destroying engine. You can

319
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,989
see it across Europe and you can see it, alas, in this country as well.

320
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,989
Gisela rightly mentioned the case of Ford. I would also mention what

321
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,989
happened to Tate Lyle, who tonight announced they want to come out of

322
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,989
the EU because of the destruction that the EU's Common Agricultural

323
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,989
Policy has wrought upon them. Not just on jobs in London but in the

324
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,989
developing world who want to export cane sugar to the EU. I would

325
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,989
also... APPLAUSE. I would mention Tata

326
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,989
Steel. We are told we cannot cut our energy costs to protect jobs in Port

327
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,989
Talbot because Brussels says no. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Nonsense.

328
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,989
It's a lie! Hold on. It is perfectly true. One lie after another after

329
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,989
another. Just cool it everybody for a moment. Ruth Davidson. You are

330
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,989
going to be asked to vote in two days' time and all you've heard is

331
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,989
trust us and it will all be fine. That's not good enough. They won't

332
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,989
tell us how much our economy will be hit by, won't tell us how many jobs

333
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,989
might go, what they are going to replace a single market with. If you

334
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,989
vote on Thursday, you cannot change your mind on Friday. If we vote to

335
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,989
come out of the biggest free trade bloc in the world, there'll be

336
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,989
tariffs put on British businesses. That will affect our ability to

337
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,989
trade abroad. It is not just the 27 we trade with now as part of the EU,

338
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,989
but there are 50 other countries in the world the EU has trade deals

339
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,989
with. If they come out, we go to the back of the queue. That's not

340
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,989
Project Fear. That's what Obama said. They want a deal with 500

341
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,989
million, not 50 million people. 80% of the world's economy is not in

342
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,989
the single market. The free trade deals that Ruth is talking about

343
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,989
that the EU has, those free trade deals are many of them, most of

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,989
them, 46 of the 50 countries are not in the single market. Many countries

345
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,989
in the world do more business with the EU than the UK does. You do not

346
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,989
need to be in the single market. We are the fifth biggest economy in the

347
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,989
world. Most economies can agree free trade deals within two years. The

348
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,989
European Union is taking ten years or never at all. Why? Because 28

349
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,989
member states cannot even organise a takeaway curry, let alone what

350
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,989
they're going to do on free trade with the rest of the world. All

351
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,989
right. The line was - we do not need to be in the single market. When you

352
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,989
are 5'6" it's not often you say size matters. But size matters awe the

353
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:28,989
bigger you are the -- because the bigger you are the more cloud you

354
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,989
have. -- cloud we have. Clout. If you are a company in China, America,

355
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,989
India, and you want to do business with 500 million customers, you can

356
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,989
have your headquarters in London and have a gateway to 500 million

357
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,989
customers. Boris you should know better. I speak to businesses around

358
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,989
our city every day of the week. You know what, half a million jobs in

359
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,989
London directly dependent on the European Union. I speak to companies

360
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,989
around the world, more than 60% of the world's leading companies, Sony,

361
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,989
AIG insurance, have their European headquarters, guess where? Here in

362
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,989
London. Half our exports goes to Europe. Boris, why have you suddenly

363
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,989
changed your mind? APPLAUSE

364
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,989
All right. Since we have a former Mayor of London and the present

365
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,989
Mayor of London... I think we've heard an amazing amount of running

366
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,989
down of our city and our country. We're proud of our city. The

367
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,989
astonishing thing is that they underestimate our ability to do

368
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,989
better deals if we're left to do it on our own. Let me give you an

369
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,989
example. Because of the EU system, our entire trade negotiating policy

370
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,989
is handed over to the EU Commission, where only 3. 6% of the officials

371
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,989
actually come from our country. It is no wonder that they have not

372
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,989
been, as Andrea rightly says, they have not done free trade deals with

373
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,989
China, India, the great economies of the world, including America, to the

374
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,989
extent, to the point where we - Just one question. We cannot because the

375
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,989
EU is in charge of our trade negotiations export Haggas. We

376
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:33,989
cannot export Haggas to America! Come on. Come on. All right. Boris.

377
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,989
Boris. Let's leave the haggis. Can you name me one country in the world

378
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,989
that has said it will give us a better deal if we come out of the

379
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,989
EU? The United States. Obama says we would go to the back of the queue.

380
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,989
All right. On that note, we have to move on. We've got a lot more to

381
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,989
talk about. We take a pause here where we can cool down. They'll warm

382
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,989
up again in a moment. Over to the other end of the hall here to hear

383
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,989
reaction from her guests to the debate so far.

384
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,989
David, throughout the course of the programme, we're going to be hearing

385
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,989
from this panel as well on the key issues. There are ten of them in

386
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,989
all, five from the Remain side and five from the Leave side. Let's

387
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,989
start our economic discussion over here with Priti Patel, Conservative

388
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,989
MP and Employment Minister. Are you part of a Government that asked

389
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,989
people to vote Ono the basis of not taking aI risk with the economy. How

390
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,989
does that square with what you're asking people to do now? We've heard

391
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,989
clearly tonight that we're the optimists. We have a brighter,

392
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,989
prosperous future outside the European Union, a complete contrast

393
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,989
to the Remain side that want to constantly talk Britain down. We've

394
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,989
heard clearly about the freedom to succeed, we can negotiate new trade

395
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,989
deals. It's pessimistic to hear from the Remain side that they're not

396
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,989
even interested in doing that. They don't want new partnerships. They

397
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,989
don't want new relationships. They clearly don't want to trade with the

398
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,989
2. 2 billion potential customers that exist globally in the

399
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,989
Commonwealth countries. That's about the future of our economy. Before I

400
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,989
go to the Remain side, I want to turn to you Tim Martin, founder and

401
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,989
chairman of Wetherspoons. Answer the charge that leaving the EU would

402
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,989
roll back workers' rights at a company like yours. It's complete

403
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,989
and utter nonsense. She picked on us for some reason. We pay 40% of our

404
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,989
profits as bonuses to staff that work in our pubs. No-one gets a

405
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,989
fortune, but I should have a reply to that, no-one gets a fortune, but

406
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,989
apart from John Lewis partnerships, so far as I'm aware, no-one pays a

407
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,989
bigger bonus to our staff. The rights that workers have now... We

408
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,989
will certainly not give up our workers' rights. Why do that? We

409
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,989
paid above what we had to for many years, long before the EU told us

410
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:19,989
what to do. Let me get a different perspective from business. This time

411
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,989
from Justin King, who ran one of our biggest supermarkets, Sainsbury's,

412
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,989
for ten years. Where Remain? This is presented as if it's a straight

413
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,989
choice. I think we can have the best of both worlds. We have a place in

414
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,989
Europe, which is unique and has allowed our country to prosper.

415
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,989
Almost everything the Remain camp is saying we ought to do, we can do

416
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,989
whilst still part of Europe. Germany's, four of their biggest

417
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,989
trading partners are outside of Europe. We are going to see real

418
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,989
damage to our economy. That's bad for small business, they'll be the

419
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,989
first to lose jobs. We'll see prices go up because our currency is going

420
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,989
to be hurt and a poorer economy means all the services, the taxes

421
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,989
and vibrant economy pay more will be harmed. You're sitting next to Sarah

422
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,989
Woollaston, until a short time ago you I Would Do Anything For Love

423
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,989
have been on the other side. I've listened to the evidence. It's clear

424
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,989
our NHS, health research will be hit if we leave. There will be less

425
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,989
money for those services and it will hit the workforce. It will hit our

426
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,989
leadership role in research and development and cooperation with our

427
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,989
European partners. There will be a very serious Brexit penalty for the

428
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,989
NHS, make no mistake. If people are caring about the NHS and research

429
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,989
when they make their vote, I would say vote to Remain with our European

430
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,989
partners. I will get a couple of quick thoughts. I want to turn to

431
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,989
you, from women for Britain. Work for Morrisons. What do you think

432
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,989
about what Justin King said about prices going up. I want to focus on

433
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,989
the rights, particularly what the Remain side were saying. We had the

434
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,989
first Equal Pay Act by the first female minister of state three years

435
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,989
before we joined the European Union. We have the sex discrimination act,

436
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,989
the domestic violent act -- violence act, and Margaret Thatcher the first

437
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,989
female Prime Minister without European Union assistance. Are you

438
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,989
seriously saying those rights and protections are just going to

439
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,989
disappear overnight? Of course not. A final thought now from Tim Farron.

440
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,989
You could dismiss the economic arguments as project fear. Nine out

441
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,989
of ten experts say we're better off in the European Union. Michael Gove

442
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,989
said we've had enough of experts, that's perhaps an explanation of why

443
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,989
he was such a dreadful Education Secretary.

444
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,989
CHEERING When I send my kids to school, I

445
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,989
want them to be taught by experts not the bloke down the pub. I went

446
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,989
to a small business in my constituency, they are exporting to

447
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,989
Romania. They provide play equipment over there. That contract is

448
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,989
entirely contingent, if we vote out on Friday, they lose that contract.

449
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,989
That's the case for hundreds of businesses across the country. Thank

450
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,989
you very much. More from this panel later on. David, back to you.

451
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,989
Now, the second topic is immigration. The second big argument

452
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,989
in this whole case. Before the questions and the debate, a reminder

453
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,989
of the question issues identified ash the subject -- around the

454
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,989
subject of immigration. 508 million people live in the

455
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,989
European Union. Freedom of movement means that all EU citizens have the

456
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,989
right to live and work in any member state. Last year net migration from

457
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,989
other EU countries, the difference between the number of people coming

458
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,989
into the UK and going out, was 184,000. From elsewhere in the wore,

459
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,989
it was 188,000. The European figure has risen a lot since the EU

460
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,989
expanded in 2004. There are now around three million citizens of

461
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,989
other EU countries living in the UK. An estimated 1. 2 million British

462
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,989
citizens living elsewhere in the EU. Because the UK is not a member of

463
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,989
the border-free Schengen area, anyone arriving here has to show a

464
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,989
passport and they can be refused entry if they're judged to represent

465
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,989
a serious threat to society. Last year, this happened to about 2,000

466
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,989
people from the EU. What about the future? Five countries have been

467
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,989
accepted as candidates for EU membership, Albania, Montenegro,

468
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,989
Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Current EU states have a veto over

469
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,989
any new members. Leave campaigners say staying in the EU means we won't

470
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,989
be able to control our borders or the level of immigration. Remain

471
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,989
supporters say EU immigration is good for the economy and planned

472
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,989
curbs on in-work benefits will reduce the incentive to move here.

473
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,989
So what has been the effect on Britain of EU migration? And is

474
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,989
immigration best managed within the EU or outside? So there's the issue,

475
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,989
our first question is from Jayne Williams, who is a Remain supporter.

476
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,989
My family and I have had first hand experience recently with the NHS.

477
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,989
How would it manage if we leave the EU, given the UK's inability to

478
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:43,989
train and retain sufficient doctors and nurses? Boris Johnson. I think

479
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,989
the first thing we should do tonight in a discussion about immigration is

480
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,989
celebrate immigrants and immigration and everything they do for our

481
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,989
country. Because I speak entirely personally, they are, my family has

482
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,989
benefitted massively from immigration and so, I know, have

483
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,989
millions of people watching us tonight. The crucial thing, though,

484
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,989
is to look in an informed way at what is going on, look at the

485
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,989
numbers, look at the pressure that is large-scale uncontrolled

486
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,989
immigration is causing for public services, such as the NHS. And the

487
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,989
downwards pressure on wages that I've already mentioned and that

488
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,989
Sadiq Khan has discussed. Look at the way in which we are forced by

489
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,989
our imbalanced system to push away people who might contribute mightily

490
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,989
to our NHS in favour of uncontrolled access to 510 million people from

491
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,989
the rest of the EU. What we think should happen is an

492
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,989
Australian-style, points-based system, so we get the people we need

493
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,989
for the NHS and indeed all our other businesses and services and the only

494
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,989
way you can do that is to vote Leave and take back control on Thursday.

495
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,989
Sadiq Khan. Firstly, Australia has double our

496
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,989
immigration, bearing in mind their population. I don't want facts to

497
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,989
get in the way Boris, of course, we need to have a fair immigration

498
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,989
policy. It shouldn't be a free for all. You don't hear me say this

499
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,989
often, David Cameron deserves credit for the deal he negotiated with the

500
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,989
EU. What it means is you pay in before you can take out. You have to

501
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,989
work four years before you can receive full benefits. Here's the

502
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,989
nub of it, immigration has brought huge economic, cultural and social

503
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,989
benefits to our country. The EU migrants more than 130,000 work in

504
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,989
the NHS and social care, thank you EU migrants work in our schools and

505
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,989
our construction sector. Thank you. More than 1. 5 million Brits

506
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,989
recommend ployed by companies owned by EU citizens here. Thank you. Are

507
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,989
employed. You might start off saying how wonderful immigration is. Your

508
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,989
campaign hasn't been project fear. It's been project hate as far as

509
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,989
immigration's concerned. CHEERING Gisela.

510
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:33,989
All right. All right. I am an immigrant. Sorry. I am an immigrant.

511
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,989
I'm also a mother and a grandmother. I think it is important that as we

512
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,989
plan for our public services, like the NHS, like the schools, like

513
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,989
housing, that we actually can plan ahead properly. And if we have

514
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,989
uncontrolled immigration, with the best will of the world, we will have

515
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,989
situations, like in the West Midlands, where there are 50,000

516
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,989
primary school places missing. This is simply a statement of fact. If

517
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,989
you cannot plan. What I object to... APPLAUSE

518
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,989
I think this is really important. The current immigration policies

519
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,989
unfairly discriminates against non-EU citizens.

520
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:30,989
APPLAUSE. Frances O'Grady. Jane made a really, really important point in

521
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,989
her question about our NHS. Let's not forget the NHS was built by and

522
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,989
for working people, and we should all be really proud of it.

523
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,989
APPLAUSE. But we've got thousands of EU nationals and from all ousands of

524
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,989
EU nationals and from all over the world - nurses, midwives, doctors,

525
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,989
other health professionals, the whole health team, working to save

526
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,989
lives and keep us healthier. We should give them credit where it is

527
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,989
due and recognise there would be a staffing crisis if we lost that

528
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,989
staff. There would be longer waiting lists, fewer life-saving drugs.

529
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,989
Drugs. David, if I may, I've got a really important question that I

530
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,989
just learned about today. Because today we learned that Vote Leave

531
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,989
took a 600,000 pound donation from a former member of the BNP. Are you

532
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:43,989
going to pay it back? APPLAUSE. A brief answer from one of

533
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,989
you to that question. That is unworthy of this debate.

534
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,989
CHEERING. There are millions of people who've very real and genuine

535
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,989
concerns about the impact of free movement on this country and who've

536
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,989
donated to a campaign to Vote Leave and take back control. The problem

537
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,989
with free movement, for me as a mum it is not just about uncontrollable

538
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,989
numbers coming here and putting pressure on public services. It's

539
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,989
all about security, for all of our children, for all of us. Free

540
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,989
movement does not allow us to even ask people if they have a criminal

541
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,989
record. The European Court has overruled British judges in being

542
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,989
able to deport criminals. We know Ron Noble, the former head of

543
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,989
Interpol, has said that the Schengen-free area in Europe is like

544
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,989
hanging out a sign welcoming terrorists to Europe. It is creating

545
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,989
enormous problems. APPLAUSE. Before I go to the other

546
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,989
side, can I remind you of Jane's question? The second half was, how

547
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,989
would we manage if we left the EU given the UK's inability to retain

548
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,989
doctors and nurses? As Gisela said, at the moment uncontrollable

549
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,989
immigration from the EU means we discriminate against 92% of the

550
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,989
world. There are brilliant health professionals in South-East Asia, in

551
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,989
China, in South America who would love to come here, but we have to

552
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,989
put up the barriers to them because we are required to allow people to

553
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,989
come here from the EU, whether or not they are trained to support our

554
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,989
health services. Thank you. Ruth Davidson. Immigration is hard and it

555
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,989
is really tempting to believe that there's one single silver bullet

556
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,989
like leaving theic that can fix it all. Yes, take back control. But

557
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,989
there is. We need a proper, credible plan to manage migration. They don't

558
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,989
have a credible plan, where you used to be able to come and take out

559
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,989
without putting in. That's changing. They say they want a points system.

560
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,989
Migration Watch says it will mean more people coming from outside the

561
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,989
UK to live here rather than yeah. Boris wants an amnesty for illegal

562
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,989
immigrants. They have had a poster in this campaign but they don't have

563
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,989
a plan for managing migration. There isn't a silver bullet.

564
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,989
APPLAUSE.. Gisela? I want to respond to some of the I think unnecessary

565
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,989
invective we heard earlier on by pointing out that somebody on the

566
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,989
panel opposite said only a couple of years ago, in the past we were too

567
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,989
quick to dismiss concerns about immigration, even worse accuse

568
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,989
people of prejudice. Who do you think that was? It was Sadiq Khan,

569
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,989
again. I do agree with Sadiq, you need a grown up approach to this.

570
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,989
I'm passionately a believer in immigration but it's got to be

571
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,989
controlled. When you've got numbers running at 330,000 net globally,

572
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,989
184,000 net from the EU, 77,000 coming without even the offer of a

573
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,989
job last year, it's obviously time to take back control, and the answer

574
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,989
to your question is have the Australian-style points-based

575
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,989
system. Boris, all of us accept that there are legitimate concerns about

576
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,989
immigration that need to be addressed. You are not being honest

577
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,989
by admitting you haven't got a silver bullet. You are scaring

578
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,989
people to vote to leave the EU. You are telling lies. Turkey is not set

579
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,989
to join the EU. Boris, you are telling lies and you are scaring

580
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,989
people, because you've used taxpayers' money to put out an

581
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,989
election leaflet that says Turkey set to join. There's a map, there's

582
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,989
a map. This map shows in red, Turkey, but the only countries named

583
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,989
in this map are Syria and Iraq. That's scaremongering Boris and you

584
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:13,989
should be ashamed. CHEERING. Gisela?

585
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,989
I would quite like the real David Cameron to step forward and tell us

586
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,989
what the policy on Turkey is. Because on the one hand he tells us

587
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,989
it will be the year 3000, or is it now 30 years? On the other hand, we

588
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,989
are spending ?1.9 billion of your money to accelerate accession of

589
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,989
Turkey. We've got a special section in the embassy to deal with speeding

590
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,989
up accession. He has just three months ago signed a joint statement

591
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,989
with all the other Heads of Government of the European Union to

592
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,989
accelerate accession. They are negotiating visa access of 1 million

593
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,989
from Turkey. He refuse to do so say he'll use his veto. Which David

594
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,989
Cameron are we going to believe? APPLAUSE. Ruth Davidson? Let me

595
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,989
answer on Turkish accession and let me say this. It is not going to

596
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,989
happen. It's just simply not on the cards. Not my words, Boris Johnson

597
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,989
said that on LBC Radio two months ago. Those were the words of Boris

598
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,989
Johnson two months ago. What's changed in two months, Boris? What's

599
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,989
changed in two months? It is simply not on the cards. It's Government

600
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,989
policy. It's Government policy. As far as I know last time I looked,

601
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,989
the Government wants to accelerate Turkish membership. I think Gisela

602
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,989
posed the dilemma clearly. It is something they want to happen in the

603
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,989
year 3000 or something they wish to accelerate. I think it is perfectly

604
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,989
reasonable to ask people whether they would rather proceed on the

605
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,989
basis of Government promises on immigration, or whether they would

606
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,989
rather take back control and institute a points-based system that

607
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,989
the electorate could actually hold the Government to account? The

608
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,989
problem at the moment... CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. The problem

609
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,989
at the moment. Boris! I'm trying to make a balance between the two

610
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,989
sides. I was asked the question. Forgive me. I know, but when you

611
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,989
talk at length, I have to go... Sadiq? Let's deal with this big fat

612
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,989
lie once and for all. Turkey isn't about to join. Until three months

613
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:41,989
ago you knew that was the case, Boris Johnson. In 1987 Turkey first

614
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,989
applied to join. There are 35 conditions, chapters... Allow him to

615
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,989
have his say, Boris. Of the 35 chanters, only one has been met. At

616
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,989
this rate it will take to the year 3000 this will they reach the

617
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,989
criteria. Uribe using the ruse of Turkey to scare people to vote to

618
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,989
leave. Youened aboth though there is no chance of them joining soon.

619
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,989
APPLAUSE.. We are moving on. Can I just say one thing to you in the

620
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,989
audience, I did say at the beginning of the debate, applause fine. Please

621
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,989
don't shout out, because you drown out the debate here and people at

622
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,989
home can't hear it. If you could just restrain yourselves, applaud if

623
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,989
you want to, but don't try to conduct a second debate with the

624
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,989
speakers on the panel. We are going to our next question, from Karim, a

625
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,989
Leave supporter. As a young working class man, I feel at the back of the

626
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,989
queue for entry level jobs, housing and public services. How many people

627
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,989
each year can the UK reasonably cope with? Frances O'Grady, your turn to

628
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,989
start. APPLAUSE. Well, there is no doubt

629
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,989
that we need to manage migration better. You're right, Karim, there

630
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,989
should be more opportunities, there should be more jobs, and not just

631
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,989
more jobs, better jobs. But I have to say I get fed up, migrants always

632
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,989
getting the blame for something that politicians in Westminster ought to

633
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,989
be doing something about. APPLAUSE. Because it seems to me

634
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,989
that zero hours, I want to tackle zero hours and I suspect everybody

635
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,989
else in this hall does too. Westminster can do something about

636
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,989
that. When it comes to paying a decent wage, that's Westminster's

637
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,989
job. And we really should be investing in more new homes, in

638
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,989
better public services where we have pressures on communities, our

639
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,989
schools and hospitals. Instead of cuts, we need investment. But

640
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,989
finally I've got to say why I get fed up with migrants being blamed

641
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,989
is, where did all this start? The big pressure on our pay and jobs

642
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,989
wasn't to do with low-paid migrant workers. It was those greedy bankers

643
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,989
crashing the economy, and if we leave will crash it again. Let's try

644
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,989
within reason to stick to the points we've been asked to raise. Rim

645
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,989
railed the point - how many people each year can the UK reasonably cope

646
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,989
with. Gisela? And that's the heart of the matter, the point you've just

647
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,989
raised, because any Government with the best will of the world when it

648
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,989
has to plan its public services, whether it is schools, whether it is

649
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,989
the NHS, whether it is training how many nurses and doctors we need,

650
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,989
housing, to get on the housing ladder, all those things are

651
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,989
impossible with the best will of the world if you have got uncontrolled

652
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,989
numbers comes in. Ave got uncontrolled numbers comes in. --

653
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,989
coming in. An Australian-type points system allows you to adjust things.

654
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,989
Australia happens to want more immigration because it is a large

655
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,989
country, but you want to reduce it. The one thing I find extraordinary,

656
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,989
uncontrolled immigration has allowed big companies not to do the kind of

657
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,989
training of our workers they ought to be doing, because they are able

658
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,989
to recruit cheap from the rest of Europe.

659
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,989
APPLAUSE. Ruth, Karim's question was he feels, he preface was he feels at

660
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,989
the back of the queue for entry level jobs for housing and public

661
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,989
services is. How many can the UK cope with? We do need to bring down

662
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,989
migration and looking at the skills you want to bring here. You used too

663
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,989
be able to come from the EU and take out the day you arrive. Now you have

664
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,989
to wait four years before you can take out full benefits. If you don't

665
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,989
find a job within six months, you can be asked to leave. Gisela talks

666
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,989
about public services, schools and hospitals, I don't think you can

667
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,989
discount the contribution migrants make, 150,000 in schools in England

668
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,989
and Wales. But my big issue is this. You don't fund schools and hospitals

669
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,989
and you don't control immigration by crashing the economy. That's what

670
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,989
leaving theic would do. APPLAUSE. Andrea? That is just

671
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,989
simply not the case. If we vote Leave and take back control this

672
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,989
Thursday, we will have a ?10 billion a year independence dividend that we

673
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,989
will be able to spend on our priorities. Not true. The Bank of

674
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,989
England has been very clear in its report, that uncontrolled

675
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,989
immigration has had downward pressure on wages in this country.

676
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,989
They simply haven't had a pay rise for years. Not only that, but every

677
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,989
family in this country knows how difficult it is to get the primary

678
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,989
school place of your choice, to get a doctor's appointment, and yes to

679
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,989
afford rents or to get on to the housing ladder. These are the really

680
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,989
legitimate concerns and the way to get over that is by voting Leave and

681
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,989
takeing back control on Thursday. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. I've got to

682
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,989
come back on this. Immigration is a concern to a lot of people but

683
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,989
leaving theic isn't the answer. Yes, it is.

684
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,989
CHEERING. But it's not. How is it having more control if you have less

685
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,989
money in your pocket as Martin Lewis the money expert says? How is it

686
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,989
more control if we have a recession as the Bank of England says. How is

687
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,989
it more control if we are not investing in the schools and

688
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,989
hospitals and GP practices, if Karim can't get a job because local

689
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,989
employers are suffering, or how is it control if it is double the

690
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,989
immigration, and the points system, more control if there are businesses

691
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,989
from China, India and America choosing Germany and France over

692
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,989
London. How is it more control if young people don't have the

693
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,989
opportunity that we have? CHEERING.

694
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,989
I think Boris, it's your turn. Let me say directly to Sadiq Khan, I

695
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,989
think there's a lot of agreement around this panel. And they should

696
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,989
come over and join our side. Everything I've heard tonight is

697
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,989
their admission that something is wrong with our immigration system.

698
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,989
There's only one way to fix it and that is to take back control and day

699
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,989
after day, in the last week, we've seen senior figures in the Labour

700
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,989
Party, Jeremy Corbyn this morning, he's the leader...

701
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,989
LAUGHTER Said there was no way of controlling

702
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,989
immigration as long as we're in the EU. Tom Watson, Harriet Harman,

703
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,989
they're all finally accepting that the deal that was done did

704
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,989
absolutely nothing to restore control of our immigration system to

705
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,989
this country. There is only one way to achieve that.

706
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,989
APPLAUSE There is only one way to achieve

707
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,989
that and that is to vote Leave and take back control and put in the

708
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,989
Australian-style, points-based system that makes sure that we get

709
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,989
the people that we need to help our business, our NHS, but do not - I

710
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,989
find it a bit rich to listen to you... Boris, I find it a little bit

711
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,989
rich to hear people saying they're worried about wages, when your

712
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,989
Government has imposed a pay cap on six million public servants year

713
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,989
after year after year after year. Can I also say, Karim's question was

714
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,989
about numbers. I think the Leave campaign is selling people a big

715
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,989
con. Because you're not promising to reduce numbers. You have never

716
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,989
promised to reduce numbers. Yes, we have. And you're pretending that you

717
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,989
are going to reduce numbers. It's a big con. Don't believe them. This is

718
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,989
a one way ticket. If we're out, we're out. We will pay with our jobs

719
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,989
and wage it's we go. The accusation is that you've never

720
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,989
promised on the Leave campaign to reduce numbers, is that true? What

721
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,989
an Australian-style, points-based system would allow you is to decide

722
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,989
what the numbers are. At the moment, you can't. But can I just make

723
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,989
another point, this debate today actually isn't about - Sorry, can

724
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,989
you answer her point. APPLAUSE

725
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,989
Has the Leave campaign promised to reduce numbers? We say you take back

726
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,989
controll and you can decide. What we have not done is what the Prime

727
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,989
Minister has done and actually prom ilsed he would reduce it to the tens

728
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,989
of thousands, even though he couldn't do it. You're not

729
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,989
promising, it's a con. This is not about the six of us here on the

730
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,989
podium and the debate, this is about my children's future, your

731
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,989
children's future, our grand children's future. I think unless we

732
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,989
take back control over something as important as that we won't be able

733
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:37,989
to provide the public services they deserve.

734
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,989
APPLAUSE I do just have to remind people at

735
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:54,989
home in case they're mistaking that there are mums and dads and nans and

736
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,989
granddads on this side of the argument. The immigration issue is a

737
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,989
complex one which needs a grown up argument. We're not having it

738
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,989
tonight. Britain deserve better than people who say they have a quick fix

739
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,989
but won't tell you what it means for Britain. We need a much bigger

740
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:22,989
conversation than this. That just is completely nonsense. This country

741
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,989
will do incredibly well if we take back control and vote Leave. What we

742
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,989
will be able to do is to manage the numbers of people who are coming to

743
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,989
this country so that we can be fair to those who come here and fair to

744
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,989
those who already live here. What we've had for a number of years now

745
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,989
is a situation where people's pay is down, where the skills training is

746
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,989
down, where there's pressure on all of our public services, including

747
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,989
school places, doctors places and the housing market. The only way we

748
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,989
will ever get that back under control is if we vote Leave on this

749
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,989
Thursday. All right. Thank you very much. We'll take a brief pause again

750
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,989
and go to the other side of the hall.

751
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,989
Immigration has been an important part of this debate for the Leave

752
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,989
side. So let me start our discussion of it with the Remain side. Caroline

753
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,989
Lucas, Green Party MP, how would you address the real concerns that

754
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,989
people have about the impact of migration on housing, on school

755
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,989
places, on health? It's exactly about the real concerns, the real

756
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,989
concerns is about pressure. But that's not caused by immigration.

757
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,989
That is caused by successive governments' failure to invest in

758
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,989
those services. We have heard that you are far more likely to find

759
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,989
someone from another EU country treating you in the NHS rather than

760
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,989
getting in ahead of you. Migration is going to be a large part of this.

761
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,989
We have the freedom to live and learn, study and work in 27 other

762
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,989
countries ourselves. What an amazing gift is that? When you consider that

763
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,989
people coming to our country are bringing with them not only benefits

764
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,989
to our society and our culture, but also to our economy. Let us

765
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,989
ring-fence the money they are paying into our tax system and use that to

766
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,989
build leisure centres and libraries in those places under pressure, so

767
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,989
everybody can benefit. There's a two-way street here. I want to get a

768
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,989
thought from the SNP. Your party's rare in British politics, it has

769
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,989
campaigned for more immigration. I don't care if it's unpopular. Let's

770
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,989
stick with the facts. Migrants contribute more than they take out

771
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,989
of the system. Let me just say this much. I have been so depressed at

772
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,989
the state of the debate around immigration and the worst of that we

773
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,989
saw last week, when Nigel Farage unveiled a poster that I'm going to

774
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,989
say it was xenophobic and frankly, bordering on racist. Dianne James

775
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,989
from Ukip here should hang her head in shame and apologise to the

776
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,989
British people for lowering this debate into the worst type of

777
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,989
debate. Migrants contribute. They contribute to our public services.

778
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,989
They contribute to our economy. They even contribute to our cuisine. And

779
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,989
thank God for it. Let me turn to Dianne James now. Hang your head in

780
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,989
shame. Nigel Farage has apologised. Let's put a reality check, please.

781
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,989
That photograph - Are awe shamed of the poster? That photograph went up

782
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,989
on social media the minute the MP was murdered. It was taken down.

783
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,989
That picture and pictures exactly the same appeared in the media well

784
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,989
before in the early part of this year, highlighting what is

785
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,989
completely wrong with the Schengen system, what is completely wrong

786
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,989
with the EU fundamental tenent of freedom ever movement of people. I

787
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,989
want to turn to Tony Parsons. Is immigration part of why you want to

788
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,989
leave the EU? It's definitely part of. It I personally have nothing

789
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,989
against migrants. I like them so much I married one. I think it's a

790
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,989
bit rich that the Remain side are so devoid of any arguments that they

791
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,989
have to smear us as racists and bigots because we're not. Because we

792
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,989
love our country. We love our country. And I have not heard one

793
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,989
argument about how if we're too timid, if we're too frightened, too

794
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,989
small to leave this rotting carbuncle of the European Union, how

795
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,989
do we accommodate a third of a million people? Are you up for

796
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,989
sharing a platform with Ukip that unveiled that poster? I think

797
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,989
there's been a broad range of opinion. You can laugh all the like,

798
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,989
but you're so desperate, because you have no answers about how we build a

799
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,989
city the size of Wolverhampton every year because you can't answer it.

800
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,989
Thank you. I want to turn back to the Remain side. I want to turn to

801
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,989
Justin King. Your business, the business you used to run,

802
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,989
Sainsbury's, could just employ more British workers if we said goodbye

803
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,989
to freedom of movement. And they do. Sainsbury's and many other

804
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,989
businesses. There are more people born in the UK in work in the UK

805
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,989
today than at any time in our history. That is a fact. There are

806
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,989
more people in employment in total in this country than at any time in

807
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,989
our history. That's part of our economic success. Over 80% of

808
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,989
migrants are in work net, as we've heard, time and again, contributing

809
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,989
to our economy. That's a powerful part of our economic success. Answer

810
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,989
the point there about how we can cope with the population increase,

811
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,989
you care about the NHS, you're a former GP. How can we cope? It's

812
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,989
shameful to blame migrants for queues in the NHS. The queues will

813
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,989
get longer if we leave the EU on this Thursday. Absolutely make no

814
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,989
mistake, because there'll be less money to fund the NHS. There will be

815
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,989
fewer workers able to move here freely to work. There's another

816
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,989
point I'd like to make. I have heard from NHS staff, who have told me

817
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,989
that they now feel unwelcome in this country. What a disgraceful

818
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,989
situation. I want to say thank you to all those people working in our

819
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,989
NHS, please stay. We want you to stay.

820
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,989
We'll hear from this panel once more, before the end of the

821
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,989
programme. We will indeed. Now we have so far

822
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,989
this evening talked about the referendum outcome, how it would

823
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,989
affect the economy and immigration. Our final half hour, we're going to

824
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,989
debate the big issues of democracy, security and Britain's place in the

825
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,989
world. Just before we do, a reminder of how our relationship with the EU

826
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,989
has developed over the years. The EU began in 1951 as the European

827
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,989
coal and steel community, which had six members. The idea was to create

828
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,989
an economic area to bring European nations closer to together in the

829
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,989
wake of World War II. In 1973, the UK joined what had, by then, become

830
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,989
the European economic community. And in 1975, the British people voted,

831
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,989
for the first time, on the UK's membership, deciding to remain part

832
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,989
of the EEC or Common Market. In 1993, the treaty on European Union

833
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,989
was signed in Maastricht. It was widely regarded as a step change for

834
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,989
the European project because it legally established the EU as a

835
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,989
political as well as an economic union. It also laid the foundations

836
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,989
for the introduction of the sing the currency, which Britain chose not to

837
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,989
adopt. In 2004, more countries joined the EU. It now has 28 members

838
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,989
and there is the prospect of new nations joining, if they meet the

839
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,989
criteria for entry. But current EU states have a veto over any new

840
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,989
members. Senior EU leaders are talking about the creation of a

841
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,989
European Army, and a new European intelligence agency. Leave

842
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,989
campaigners say the EU has embarked on a relentless journey to create a

843
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,989
European superstate. Remain supporters say Britain can opt out

844
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,989
of future integration. The choice at this referendum is to decide which

845
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,989
path is best for Britain - to Remain or to Leave.

846
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,989
So, our first question in this section is from Douglas Warren. He's

847
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,989
a Leave supporter. Thank you, David. 40 years ago, the

848
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,989
UK voted to join a Common Market. If we vote to remain on Thursday, how

849
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,989
can we be sure that in another 40 years, we won't find ourselves in a

850
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,989
United States of Europe? APPLAUSE

851
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,989
Britain is a sovereign, independent country, just like Germany, just

852
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,989
like France. We retain control over our defence, over the pound, over

853
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,989
interest rates, over what we do in our schools, hospitals, our public

854
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,989
transport. We chose to join the EU and we're having a referendum to

855
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,989
decide whether Remain or Leave. I tell you why I think it's important

856
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,989
to Remain. If we choose to Remain, it means we're a member of a single

857
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,989
market of 500 million customers. We can do free trade with one set of

858
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,989
rules that we help make. I tell you this, if you're living in France,

859
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,989
you aren't any less French because you're a member of the EU. If you're

860
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,989
in Germany, you're no less German because you're in the EU. We're no

861
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,989
less British because we're in the EU. I just don't accept that there's

862
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,989
a tradeoff between trade and democracy. I think democracy is

863
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,989
enormously important. APPLAUSE

864
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,989
And what we've got now is an institution that has utterly

865
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,989
outgrown its historic roots, which were noble, has now become so

866
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,989
cumbersome and the real big difference was the introduction of

867
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,989
the euro. That means you've got a failing currency, which is producing

868
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,989
50% youth unemployment in Greece. They have to sort out their

869
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,989
problems. And the best way for us is actually trade with the world, don't

870
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,989
be this inward looking block and above all...

871
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,989
APPLAUSE Above all, you take back control

872
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,989
over all the decisions you have made, because in one in 28 and

873
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,989
another five countries joining, we will become increasingly

874
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,989
insignificant in making the decisions. So let's take back

875
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:06,989
control. APPLAUSE. Ruth, I will repeat

876
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,989
Douglas's question: How can we be sure in another 40 years we won't

877
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,989
find ourselves in a United States of Europe? Because it is up to us. We

878
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:24,989
saw in the films that we as a country are not in the euro, we as a

879
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,989
country are not in Schengen. I don't think you take control by leaving

880
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,989
the EU. I think you lose control by losing your seat at the table, by

881
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,989
allowing other countries put taxes on us. You lose control by hurting

882
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,989
our economy, by hurting goods, by hurting services. We at the moment

883
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,989
make the EU work for us. We are in charge of the pound, interest rates,

884
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,989
taxes, healthcare, education, spending. We make these decisions in

885
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,989
the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament. Europe doesn't tell us

886
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,989
what to do. We make those decisions. We make decisions over when and if

887
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,989
our soldiers go to war. We make these decisions. We also because we

888
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,989
are part of the biggest free trading bloc in the UK have the highest

889
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,989
number of Brits in employment in Britain in our nation's history.

890
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,989
That's what we would lose if we left.

891
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,989
APPLAUSE. That really is an extraordinary claim. The truth is

892
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,989
that 60% of our rules and regulations come from the European

893
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,989
Union. That is a lie. And ALL TALK AT ONCE.

894
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,989
One at a time. I'm told you can't do this, you can't do this because of

895
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,989
the EU. There are five presidents of the EU. Can anyone name them? And

896
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,989
did anyone vote for them? You don't vote, for them because you are not

897
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,989
allowed to vote for them, and you can't kick them out either.

898
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,989
APPLAUSE. The problem is that in the EU there are 10,000 officials,

899
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,989
nearly twice the number of people in this room by the way, who earn more

900
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,989
than the UK Prime Minister. And you're paying for them. And that

901
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,989
gravy train is continuing. So we, we, Britain, have voted against

902
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,989
Europe 70 times. And 70 times we have been outvoted. So how does that

903
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:26,989
mean we have any influence in Europe?

904
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,989
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Frances? I think we've already heard Britain is

905
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,989
a sovereign state, and we should be proud of that. We do control our

906
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,989
taxes, our public spending, all these other decisions that sometimes

907
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,989
Westminster politicians like to blame on Brussels. We do make those

908
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,989
decisions. But where you have a fantastic market that gives you real

909
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,989
bargaining power in the global economy of 500 million people on

910
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,989
which 3 million jobs depend, then of course you should have fair rules

911
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,989
that everybody has to play by. Again, I keep hearing about

912
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,989
regulation, these are our rights. This is about treating workers

913
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,989
fairly. We should be proud of that. I will be honest with you, I'm proud

914
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,989
of being British, but there is nothing patriotic about a lack of a

915
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,989
plan as to what even would happen if we came out? There is nothing

916
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,989
patriotic about putting people's jobs at risk.

917
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,989
APPLAUSE. I think we've heard enough from Project Fear over the last

918
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,989
couple of weeks, I really do. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. I will give

919
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,989
you one statistic. They go on and on about the single market. Let me tell

920
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:00,989
you, since the dawn of the single market, which I remember reporting,

921
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,989
there have been, 1992 it January 1993, there've been 27 countries

922
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,989
that have done better than the United Kingdom at exporting goods

923
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,989
into the single market, they include India, China and America. The best

924
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,989
place for us is to be out of this morass, this supreme legal system.

925
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,989
Sadiq Khan is completely wrong. The European Court of Justice is the

926
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,989
supreme legal authority in our country. From which, and he knows

927
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,989
that because he's a lawyer, he would not deny that. Deny it. You would

928
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,989
not deny it. The European Court of Justice is acquiring steadily more

929
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,989
powers. Under the Lisbon Treaty the EU expended by about 45 new areas of

930
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:56,989
competence, and the European Court of Justice... And a United States

931
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,989
state of Europe? Adjudicating in home affairs matters of deporting

932
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,989
terrorist suspects, divorce laws, nothing to do with the idea of a

933
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,989
single market. And the United States of Europe. Boris, I have to leave

934
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,989
you because you've gone on, a United States of Europe in 40 years, yes or

935
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,989
no Remember what John Major said about the single currency. He said

936
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,989
it had all the quaintness and implausibility of a rain dance and

937
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,989
look where it is now, destroying jobs across the European Union.

938
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,989
Let's get out of this thing and we'll do better, creating free trade

939
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,989
deals. Vote Leave and take back control.

940
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,989
APPLAUSE. Ruth? So that's a no then. Even Boris Johnson doesn't think

941
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,989
there is going to be a United States of Europe in 40 years' time. There's

942
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,989
one now. I need to pick up on something Andrea said. I can't let

943
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,989
it stand you make a blatant untruth. 60% of our laws is made in Europe,

944
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,989
she says. It is simply not true. 13% of our laws, according to the

945
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,989
independent House of Commons library, that number is 13%. In the

946
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,989
last five-year Parliament it was four. Four bills out of 121 that

947
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,989
came out of Europe. I think there is a real question here that you're

948
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,989
being asked to make a decision that's irreversible. We wake up on

949
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,989
Friday, we don't like it and it was sold on a lie. They lie about the

950
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,989
cost of Europe, about Turkey's entry to Europe. They lie about the

951
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,989
European Army, because we've got a veto on that. They've lied about

952
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,989
that too and it is not good enough. You deserve the truth, you deserve

953
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,989
the truth. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Gisela? You

954
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,989
do deserve the truth. If the Prime Minister is refusing to say that he

955
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,989
would exercise his veto over Turkey, what do you this I he's going to

956
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,989
veto? Let's be clear about the United States of Europe, which

957
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,989
Douglas addresses. Those countries in the eurozone will have to

958
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,989
integrate more deeply. And in a sense we have already left, because

959
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,989
they have to do things in their own interests and we are purely

960
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,989
peripheral. So the best thing to do is come back and take control. The

961
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,989
other thing, there are a number of things out there which the European

962
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,989
Commission is holding back until after the referendum. Tax

963
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,989
identification number, European-wide. We have not vetoed

964
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,989
that. Why do you think that's going to happen?

965
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,989
APPLAUSE. Can I just say... Can I say very proudly that I choose to

966
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,989
work with the EU to fight climate change. I choose to work with the EU

967
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,989
to fix air quality. I choose to work good EU to deal with the refugee

968
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,989
crisis. I choose to work with the EU to fight terrorism and organised

969
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,989
crime. I choose to work with the EU to fight tax evasion. Let me tell

970
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,989
you what else. One of the most important jobs I have as Mayor of

971
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,989
London is to keep our city safe. In July 2005 our city was under attack.

972
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,989
On 7th July is terrorists were successful. 52 Londoners died. On

973
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,989
21st July, they weren't. All the men were arrested except for one. He

974
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,989
fled our country and went to Italy. Before the European Arrest Warrant,

975
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,989
he would have been there for years and years and years, like Costa del

976
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,989
Sol. What happened? He fled here in July, he was brought back in

977
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,989
September. He is serving 40 years in prison for terrorism. Justice

978
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:52,989
delivered by the European Union. CHEERING.

979
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,989
APPLAUSE. Our second question tonight, our final question from the

980
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,989
floor, is from Alex. Alex Trembath is supporting the Remain side. Can

981
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,989
we have your question, please? Is it a coincidence that the longest

982
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,989
period of peace in European history has happened at the same time as the

983
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:22,989
emergence of the European Union? CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Gisela

984
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,989
Stuart? The post-World War II deal was to fold. The Common Market was

985
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,989
supposed to provide economic stability. NATO was supposed to

986
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,989
provide military stability. APPLAUSE. What we've got now is that

987
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,989
the European Union is not keeping up with the deal. It is creating

988
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,989
unemployment in Greece. It is outsourcing its border control to

989
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,989
Turkey. It is undermining NATO by trying to duplicate the same

990
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,989
structures. Just to quote the former head of Interpol, Ronald Noble, he

991
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,989
said the EU border system is like hanging a sign welcoming in

992
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,989
terrorists to Europe. It is making us insecure rather than making us

993
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:15,989
securer. APPLAUSE. Ruth? Alex, a short answer

994
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,989
is no, there is no coincidence that we've been more or less at peace.

995
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,989
The other side have said throughout this debate they don't like experts,

996
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,989
but when it comes to keeping our country safe and secure, I want to

997
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,989
listen to the experts, so when the head of GCHQ says we are safer in

998
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,989
the EU, I listen. When five former NATO chiefs say we are safer in the

999
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,989
EU, I listen. When the head of your o poll, a Brit, says we are safer in

1000
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,989
the EU, I listen. When the head of MI5 and MI6 says we are safer in the

1001
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,989
EU, I listen. When all all of our major allies - America, Canada, all

1002
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,989
of our major allies - America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -

1003
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,989
say we are safer in the EU, I listen. And if it comes to a choice,

1004
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,989
if it comes to a choice of listening to all of these people, even if they

1005
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,989
are experts, or listening to these three about who keeps my family

1006
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,989
safe, I'm going to vote for them every day of the week and twice on a

1007
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,989
Sunday. Don't risk it. APPLAUSE. Andrea? Let's be clear

1008
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,989
about this. The UK has always benefitted from being a founder

1009
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,989
member of NATO. We have one of the few permanent seats on the UN

1010
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,989
Security Council. We are one of the ity Council. We are one of the five

1011
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,989
Is for -- one of the five eyes for intelligence. We share it across the

1012
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,989
world with other English-speaking nations. Of course we co-operate

1013
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,989
with the European Union and we will continue to do so. But Field Marshal

1014
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,989
Lord Guthrie, Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike rose,

1015
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,989
commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Major General Julian Thompson,

1016
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,989
marine commander of the Falkland, they say that UK security rests on

1017
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,989
NATO co-operation, not on the EU. Lord givery says many European

1018
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,989
politicians like to say that it was the EU that made everything

1019
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,989
peaceful. It was not. It was the leadership of the Americans.

1020
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,989
APPLAUSE.. Frances? I want to return to Alex's question, because this is

1021
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,989
not just about history. I want to bring it closer to home. Many trade

1022
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,989
unionists and other campaigners in Britain and Ireland worked together

1023
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,989
for many years to support the peace process in Northern Ireland. And it

1024
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,989
took a lot of hard work. We've supported the good Friday agreement

1025
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,989
ever since. The wonderful thing is that people can come from different

1026
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,989
traditions, come from different communities, but they see themselves

1027
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,989
as common citizens of the EU. The Irish Prime Minister has said that

1028
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,989
if we come out of the EU, there will have to be border controls. Let me

1029
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,989
tell you, the way that is seen in Belfast and Derry, I really worry

1030
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:15,989
for our future. APPLAUSE. This is not the time to be

1031
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:23,989
building... We should be building bridges between people, not walls.

1032
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,989
APPLAUSE. For the sake of the Irish, vote to stay in. Boris? I believe,

1033
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,989
alas, the EU is going in totally the wrong direction. It is a mistake for

1034
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,989
it to try to take on this defence component and try to evolve into a

1035
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,989
United States of Europe in the way that it is. I remember when the EU

1036
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,989
was given the task of trying to sort out the tragedy in the Balkans. You

1037
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,989
will remember what was happening in Bosnia. The EU was mandated

1038
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,989
specifically for four years, the EU was given that diplomatic and indeed

1039
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,989
military task. It was a disaster, about 1 million people died. It was

1040
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,989
only solved when the Americans came in. I was there. I remember

1041
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,989
reporting it. We saw what happened when the Dayton accords and NATO

1042
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,989
finally asserted primacy. That was the right thing. I do worry about

1043
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,989
our security on the streets of this city to get back to a point that was

1044
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,989
made earlier. It is absolutely extraordinary that the the European

1045
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,989
Court of Justice, not the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but the

1046
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,989
Court of Justice in Luxembourg is telling our Home Secretary she may

1047
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,989
not support people with serious criminal convictions to other

1048
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,989
European countries, or indeed people who've been arrested for serious

1049
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,989
terrorist offences, such as Abu Hamza's daughter-in-law law. I think

1050
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,989
it is absolutely amazing, and how the Remain side have the cheek to

1051
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,989
come and tell us that we improve our security by staying in this

1052
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,989
organisation, I do not understand. The best way forward is to keep the

1053
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,989
European Arrest Warrant inter-Governmentally. Thank you.

1054
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,989
Andrea and Boris talks about our allies, talked about Nato. It's not

1055
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,989
a choice between the EU and Nato or between the EU and our allies, we

1056
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,989
can still have a special relationship with the USA and be in

1057
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,989
Nato. Which of our allies, USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia,

1058
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,989
which of the Nato members is encouraging us to leave the EU or

1059
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:34,989
says it's in our interests? Name one. Just one. Name us one. USA?

1060
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,989
Canada? News zealed? Australia? One of the Nato countries? All of them

1061
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,989
are saying we're safer together. All of them are also saying as long as

1062
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,989
the European Union keeps trying to copy what Nato does, if the

1063
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,989
countries across Europe are not paying their 2% of the GDP, which is

1064
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:01,989
the Nato contribution, we will be weakening it. Stay and fight, don't

1065
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,989
quit. Let's stay and persuade our allies to pay. Don't be a quitter.

1066
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,989
Be proud. We can do it. We heard earlier, that the Prime Minister was

1067
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,989
meant to have got a deal. That deal amounted to absolutely nothing. It's

1068
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,989
temporary. So when you've had the most serious renegotiation attempts

1069
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,989
by a British Prime Minister, certainly since I've been in

1070
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,989
politics, and the best he got out was nothing, how do you think you're

1071
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,989
going to change it after you have voted to Remain? There's a dangerer

1072
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:42,989
in remaining, vote Leave. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1073
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,989
I think Boris maybe misjudged this panel by talking about the Balkans.

1074
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,989
What he probably doesn't know is I was sent to the Balkans as a

1075
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,989
reporter. I have never been more proud in my life than watching

1076
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,989
British troops with a Union Jack on their arm to see them pulling their

1077
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,989
weight and helping in the European Union. It's what caused me to join

1078
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,989
up and serve. So I think I'm the only one on this panel who's worn

1079
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,989
the Queen's uniform. While I have the greatest respect for the retired

1080
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,989
general Lord Guthrie, the greatest of respect for him and with the

1081
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,989
greatest of respect for him, I would gently remind the other side of this

1082
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,989
debate that as a retired general, he's not currently charged with the

1083
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,989
safety and security of our nation. All those people who are currently

1084
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,989
charged, every single one of them, an every single one of our major

1085
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:36,989
allies says we are safer within the European Union. Andrea. Let's get

1086
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:43,989
back to the really important question about the UK's place in the

1087
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,989
world. Let's get back to that five president' report, the five

1088
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,989
presidents of the European Union. The report just last year is saying

1089
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,989
that by 2025 they want to see complete political and fiscal union

1090
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,989
of all 28 EU member states. So we have this one, last chance to keep

1091
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,989
our democracy, to make sure that in future, when you want to sack a

1092
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,989
Government, you can sack it and you know that it will go, that you won't

1093
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:21,989
find the very next Government that you appoint is still stuck doing the

1094
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,989
bidding of the European Union. Let's be clear, those measures that those

1095
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,989
five presidents wants to impose on us do include a European tax

1096
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,989
IDification code and they do include a European army. Let's be clear -

1097
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,989
the best way to be in charge of our own democracy is by voting Leave

1098
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:49,989
this Thursday. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1099
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,989
Sadiq. Briefly if you wo. The other side

1100
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,989
know this. They've lost the debate on the economy. There are no

1101
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,989
experts... Won the debate on the economy. There are no experts

1102
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:09,989
backing up their case. It's lies and scaremongering. You know, and this,

1103
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,989
and you want the British public to take a one-way leap in the dark

1104
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,989
without a plan. You know we can feature those plans much you know

1105
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,989
the deal we've got. We can veto any plans for integration. Oh, rubbish.

1106
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,989
You know the rights we've got. All you want to do is talk us down. You

1107
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:37,989
should know better. All right. No, we have to pause there. We've been

1108
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,989
outvoted. Now we return for one last time to Michal

1109
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,989
This vote is not about today or tomorrow, but about a choice that

1110
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,989
will matter for many years to come. So let's turn to the panel to find

1111
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,989
out what sort of Britain they would like to see. Dianne James of Ukip,

1112
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,989
is your Britain a diminished one? President Obama says the EU

1113
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,989
magnifies our influence. I'm not particularly interested in what

1114
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,989
President Obama has got to say because he won't be a president of

1115
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,989
the United States in a few months' time. I'd be more interested in what

1116
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,989
the two contowarders for that role would be. As for the Remain camp

1117
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,989
talking about trashing the economy, what about the 259 billion black

1118
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,989
hole, the 34 billion the UK has got to pick up and every single time the

1119
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,989
EU mismanages the contributions from the member states, the United

1120
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,989
Kingdom has to pick up an element of bill. I want that 34 billion back

1121
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,989
spent in the United Kingdom. I don't want to keep on funding the European

1122
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:46,989
Union, which has effectively become a failed state.

1123
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,989
I'm going to turn to Tim Farron. You have spoken about being passionate

1124
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,989
about European membership, passionate about expanding the EU,

1125
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,989
an EU army. I'm passionate about the fact that we are sat around a table

1126
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,989
with 27 countries, 11 of which a quarter a century ago were on the

1127
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,989
other side of the iron curtain. Six of which had nuclear weapons on

1128
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,989
their soil pointed right here. Today they are our friends and our

1129
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,989
neighbours. We put that at risk at our peril. This is a vote about what

1130
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,989
kind of country we are. Are we an outward looking, decent, embracing,

1131
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,989
tolerant country, confident of our place in the world? Or are we ins

1132
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,989
lar? Are we small? Are we glouring across the white cliffs of Dover?

1133
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:36,989
Something which is un-British. I'm voting in because I'm a patriot.

1134
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,989
Back to the Leave side. Tony, small, inular. I respect Tim and his

1135
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,989
opinion. I do think that we in this country, we are the oldest

1136
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,989
Parliamentary democracy in the world. I personally think we live in

1137
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,989
the greatest country in the world. I would love us to be 21st century,

1138
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,989
outward looking, international, we're having this debate tonight

1139
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,989
with all these lovely people in the capital of the world, London. But I

1140
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,989
think we need to set ourselves free. This is where Tim and I disagree. I

1141
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,989
honestly believe we need to set ourselves free from this rotting,

1142
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,989
corrupt bureaucratic institution, full of men and they are mostly

1143
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,989
men... You spoke earlier about what British women had achieved. Why

1144
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,989
would we achieve more outside the EU? David Cameron was givening the

1145
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,989
pure opportunity to reform and use our influence within the European

1146
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,989
Union to reform the union. He asked for nothing and you know what, he

1147
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,989
got nothing back. The European Union doesn't listen to us. It doesn't

1148
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,989
have our best interests at heart. So I'm voting Leave to become a citizen

1149
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,989
of the world, you know what the European Union is the sick man of

1150
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,989
the economy. Before I go back to the Remain side.

1151
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,989
You heard that long list of figures of experts, although that's a

1152
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,989
dismissive word at the moment, that Ruth Davidson had, all those people

1153
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,989
who believe we are safer in, shouldn't you be listening to them.

1154
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,989
I take the view and I will say this again, that Britain will be

1155
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,989
stronger, more secure outside of the European Union. For all the reasons

1156
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,989
that we've heard from Gisela, Andrea and Boris this evening, because we

1157
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,989
can take back control from the unelected and unaccountable,

1158
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,989
bureaucrats and the institutions in Brussels that do nothing to

1159
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,989
represent Britain. They take our money. They spend our money. They

1160
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,989
don't account for themselves fiscally. At the same time, they are

1161
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,989
having a corrosive influence when it comes to decision making on our

1162
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,989
laws. Our Parliament should be sovereign and we should be

1163
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,989
accountable to the British public. We should be able to say no to

1164
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,989
Brussels. OK, thank you.

1165
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,989
Caroline Lucas, the EU is on a path to future integration. Why should we

1166
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,989
be part TV? The EU is the -- part of it? The EU is the biggest peace

1167
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,989
project we've ever had in history. It is extraordinary that 28

1168
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,989
countries have come together to try to solve their problems through

1169
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,989
debate and discussion rather than bullets and bombs. It wasn't that

1170
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,989
long ago, since that was the way in which problems were tried to be

1171
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,989
solved here. It's been the EU that has helped to bring peace to western

1172
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,989
Europe, bring democracy to Eastern Europe. We turn our become on that

1173
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,989
at our peril. The biggest challenges today are by their very nature

1174
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,989
cross-border, climate change, international trim, the refugee

1175
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,989
crisis. We have to work cross-border in order to solve those problems.

1176
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,989
That is about taking back control. That is why we should vote Remain.

1177
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,989
Thank you. Thank you to everyone on this panel and the hashtag for it to

1178
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,989
continue, the discussion is BBC debate.

1179
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,989
Thank you very much. We began with brief opening statements. We end

1180
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,989
with concluding statements, the other way round, Ruth Davidson first

1181
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:12,989
of all for Remain. APPLAUSE

1182
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,989
Tonight was the Leave campaign's last chance to answer your

1183
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,989
questions, to spell out exactly what happens if we abandon the biggest

1184
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,989
single market in the world, to show us what a Brexit Britain would

1185
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,989
actually look like. I don't know about you, but I don't think I heard

1186
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,989
enough to be confident that they have all the answers that you need.

1187
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,989
And you have to be 100% sure. Because there's no going back on

1188
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,989
Friday morning, and your decision could cost someone else their job.

1189
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,989
Now I know that the EU isn't perfect. But the benefits far

1190
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,989
outweigh any costs. And the Britain that I know, the Britain that I love

1191
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,989
works with its friends and neighbours. It doesn't walk away

1192
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,989
from them. Sadiq, Francis and I refuse to dismiss the experts. We

1193
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,989
listen to them. The economists, the scientists, the business leaders,

1194
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,989
the trade unions, the health professionals, they all agree that

1195
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:19,989
Britain is better off in. You are better off in.

1196
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,989
There is nothing more positive than having a stronger economy,

1197
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,989
supporting jobs and opportunities. That's why I believe you should be

1198
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,989
vote Remain. Thank you. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1199
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:45,989
Thank you, Ruth. Now Boris Johnson. CHEERING

1200
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,989
At the end of this campaign, I think you'll agree, there is a very clear

1201
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,989
choice between those on their side, who speak of nothing but fear, of

1202
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,989
the consequences of leaving the EU and we on our side, who offer hope.

1203
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,989
Between those who have been endlessly rubbishing our country and

1204
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,989
running it down and those of us who believe in Britain. They say we

1205
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:18,989
can't do it. We say we can. They say we have no choice but to bow down to

1206
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,989
Brussels. We say they are woefully underestimating this country and

1207
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,989
what it can do. If we vote Leave, we can take back

1208
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,989
control of our borders, of huge sums of monies, ?10 billion a year net of

1209
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,989
our tax-raising powers, of our trade policy and of our hole law-making

1210
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,989
system, the democracy that is the foundation of our prosperity and if

1211
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,989
we stand up for democracy, we will be speaking up for hundreds of

1212
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:53,989
millions of people, around Europe, who agree with us, but who currently

1213
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,989
have no voice. If we vote Leave, and take back control, I believe that

1214
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,989
this Thursday can be our country's Independence Day.

1215
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:31,989
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE All right. All right. Please. Thank

1216
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,989
you. Thank you. That brings the debate to an end. My hope is that

1217
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,989
it's clarified some of the issues not only for you here but for people

1218
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,989
at home. I'd first of all like to thank all of you who came here to

1219
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,989
Wembley to listen to the arguments, thank you very much for listening. I

1220
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,989
was going to say quietly, I won't say quietly, for listening so keenly

1221
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:00,989
and enthusiastically to the arguments. I would like to thank all

1222
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:10,989
those with Michal and those on stage with me, thank you all very much

1223
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,989
indeed. Now, it's goodbye from the hall here, but watching all of this

1224
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,989
has been Emily Maitlis with a wide range of guests in our spin room and

1225
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,989
the question now is what have they made of what they've heard?

1226
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,989
Good evening from Wembley Arena's spin room. That debate is finished

1227
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,989
on the main stage, but this is the moment and the place that the

1228
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,989
narrative of the night may get honed. Over the next few minutes,

1229
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,989
we're going to bring you reaction from the nation's media

1230
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,989
organisations, who as you see have been gathered here. They're filing

1231
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,989
copy and column inches as the talking went on. We will be hearing

1232
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,989
from the big beasts in both the Leave and Remain campaigns, how do

1233
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,989
they think their teams inside the arena fared this evening? First,

1234
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,989
though, we head to reality check, our corner where our economics

1235
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,989
editor and Katya Adler, our Europe editor, have been digesting the

1236
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,989
facts and figures flying around this evening. Hello. Let's go with what

1237
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,989
stood out for you and we knew Turkey would come up and sure enough, that

1238
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,989
was pretty centre stage. Start us off with what we know is the truth

1239
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:22,989
there. We knew immigration would be a huge

1240
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,989
debate and an emote EU one. Is it pie in the sky that Turkey will ever

1241
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,989
join the EU? Or is it poised to join? We heard from something that

1242
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,989
it is never going to happen. That is disingenuous, because Turkey is in

1243
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,989
accession talks for the EU. EU. It has been in the last ten years. If

1244
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,989
you look at the British edgecy website in Ankara it says part of

1245
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,989
its job is to help prepare Turkey for accession. But it is nowhere

1246
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,989
near joining. In those ten years it has hardly advanced on the talks,

1247
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,989
and that's science and research, never mind freedom of speech and

1248
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,989
human rights. Even if it fulfilled all the criteria, every country,

1249
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:18,989
including the EU, would have a veto. What's the truth in that ?38, on

1250
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,989
wage? On wages? The economy Remain believe is their strong suit.

1251
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,989
Frances O'Grady made this striking claim that we would be ?38 a week

1252
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,989
worse off if Britain leaves the European Union. The big problem for

1253
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,989
the Remain camp on this economic debate is yes most large economic

1254
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,989
organisations believe that in the short term at least if Britain left

1255
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,989
the European Union there would be a short term economic hit. But Remain

1256
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,989
made into this specific number, ?38 a week. That depends on which of the

1257
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,989
models you look at. It is difficult to say from a forecast you can draw

1258
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,989
out these precise numbers. That's where the public watching it think,

1259
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,989
hang on a minute, this is only a forecast. It is about the future.

1260
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,989
How can you be that specific? We heard this phrase ntinued throughout

1261
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,989
the night - take back control. What's the truth about which side

1262
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,989
can take back control? We heard from Andrea Leadsom tonight particularly,

1263
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,989
she said this considered that within the EU we've got the freedom of

1264
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,989
movement for EU citizens. She played the safety card, she said it was

1265
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,989
impossible to stop EU citizens coming, even if they have a criminal

1266
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,989
record they can come to the UK. She is correct and incorrect, you can

1267
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,989
stop EU citizens coming from the UK. Having a criminal record isn't good

1268
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,989
enough. You have to pose that they pose an actual risk. It is possible

1269
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,989
to stop them coming. When you look at Remain, they argued strongly in

1270
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,989
favour of immigration. They said the Government here, the UK Government,

1271
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,989
has the better plan so that essential services aren't affected.

1272
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,989
You cannot plan. With freedom of movement with EU citizens you never

1273
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:01,989
know how many will apply for jobs in the UK. And growth, what do we know

1274
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,989
about that? One striking claim was that the eurozone has only Continent

1275
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,989
in the world with worse growth than the eurozone and the Leave camp said

1276
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,989
that's Antarctica. That sounds good superficially, but in growth Europe

1277
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,989
and the eurozone is doing slightly better this year and the UK and the

1278
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,989
US. If you look at continents or parts of continents like Latin Mc,

1279
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,989
they've been growing more slowly than the eurozone. It is this idea

1280
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,989
of Britain being shackled to a poorry performing eurozone has been

1281
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,989
true in the past. But there is some evidence that Europe has been

1282
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,989
growing more quickly. This Antarctica claim is increasingly

1283
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:54,989
difficult for them to execute. Thank you. There's much more expert

1284
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,989
analysis online. And on social media. One of the moments that got

1285
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,989
the assembled journalists excited this evening was that question, how

1286
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,989
the UK economy will fare outside the EU. A tricky one for the Leave

1287
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,989
campaign, with reports from economists about the risks of

1288
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,989
leading. Let's talk to one of the leading Leave voices, Michael Gove.

1289
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,989
Thank you Emily. I pointed out in a previous debate that many of the

1290
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,989
people who are urging us to stay in the European Union were the same

1291
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,989
people who got it wrong over the single currency. They made a mistake

1292
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,989
in the past. They are making a mistake now. What was really

1293
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,989
striking about tonight was the Leave side put forward an optimistic

1294
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,989
can-do hopeful case which resonated with the audience. Whereas the

1295
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,989
Remain side were concentrating very much on a pessimistic story of doing

1296
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,989
Britain down and saying that we can't cope outside the European

1297
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:01,989
Union, and if we vote to Leave we'll have war in Northern Ireland and the

1298
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,989
NHS collapsing. They accused you not of Project Fear but. In project

1299
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,989
Hate. Do you think the campaign went over the top on the immigration

1300
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,989
message? Absolutely not. Sadiq Khan has said in the past it is wrong to

1301
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,989
say that people who want migration controlled are prejudiced. You admit

1302
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,989
that it made you shudder. Do you think it has become a turning point

1303
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,989
where you don't want to push the immigration line too much? I am

1304
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,989
engaged, as the Leave campaign are, with a conversation with the British

1305
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,989
people how we can take back control of critical areas. When it comes to

1306
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,989
migration, like Boris and Gisela, as an immigrant as she pointed out, I

1307
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,989
believe Graylings is a good thing, but we need to be able to control

1308
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,989
the numbers. We cannot control the numbers if we are in the European

1309
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,989
Union. That was a point that Jeremy Corbyn made earlier this week. That

1310
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,989
panel raised the question of the ?600,000 donation from a former BNP

1311
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,989
member which you made clear you wanted to hand back. Not sure the

1312
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,989
message got through to your team up there. I think Andrea Leadsom said

1313
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,989
people have real concerns about free moment. Was has that a back for a

1314
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,989
former BNP leader there? What's happening to the money? We are

1315
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,989
investigating how this money arrived in the accounts. I think that it was

1316
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,989
an 82-year-old lady who had been signed up by the BNP by her husband,

1317
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,989
now dead, and as soon as she discovered that, she asked for her

1318
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,989
name to be taken off. We are investigating. I don't have all the

1319
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,989
facts in front of me. The imputation, is allegation behind

1320
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,989
that is people who want to Vote Leave are somehow motivated by

1321
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,989
prejudice. When you ce. When you have laugh the country ce. When you

1322
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,989
have laugh the country - I hope more - going to vote Leave it is wrong

1323
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,989
for the Remain campaign to try to indulge in personal attacks of that

1324
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,989
kind. It was conspicuous on our side and the Leave side we made

1325
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,989
optimistic arguments. We placed our faith in the British people. I fear

1326
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,989
the Remain side were trying to suggest that people people who

1327
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,989
believe in democracy and self-government are motivated by

1328
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,989
prejudice. Michael Gove, thank you for joining us. These are the

1329
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,989
headlines that voters will be reading tomorrow morning when they

1330
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,989
wake up. That being the eve of polling day. For the Remain camp

1331
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,989
there are bounds to be questions from journalists about the pressure

1332
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,989
they came under on immigration in particular how you limit the numbers

1333
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:47,989
coming to the UK. And specifically whether Turkey might join the EU.

1334
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,989
Here for the Remain camp is Chuka Umunna. Good to be here. Your side

1335
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,989
haven't managed to shut this down and that's in essence because it is,

1336
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,989
as we saw from the embassy website, that it is Government policy that

1337
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,989
Turkey should one day join, not now but one day. The myth of Turkey

1338
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,989
joining the EU was exposed in that debate. Boris Johnson himself has

1339
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,989
said it is not on the cards. For Turkey to join the European Union

1340
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,989
you have to have the agreement of all the 28 member sates of the

1341
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,989
European Union. I don't see that happening. On this immigration

1342
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,989
issue, which nobody on the stage today was denying that immigration

1343
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,989
presents challenges, but the idea that you deal with that by crashing

1344
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,989
your economy is absolutely ludicrous proposition. What you've seen from

1345
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,989
the Leave campaign is them saying different things to different

1346
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,989
communities. Andrea Leadsom was asked clearly, is it not the case

1347
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,989
that you actually want to increase immigration, you don't want to

1348
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,989
reduce immigration? She wouldn't answer the question. The bigger

1349
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,989
question is about taking back control. Yes. There are two things

1350
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,989
going on here. One, Turkey itself thinks it is in line to join the EU.

1351
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,989
So perhaps that message hasn't got through if it is not going to. And

1352
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,989
secondly, the Home Secretary, the ECJ is telling the Home Secretary

1353
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,989
she can't deport Abu Hamza's daughter-in-law law. Security, when

1354
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:24,989
the Remain side uses it, he says, is a bogus argument. Europol is headed

1355
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,989
up by the Brit. The Leave campaign have put out this list of 50 people

1356
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,989
they say they have had trouble deporting. What they don't say is

1357
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,989
130 times that number have been deported to face justice. We can

1358
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,989
tram people who pose a threat. The Leave campaign have a points-based

1359
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,989
system which they use in Australia, to promote immigration. They've got

1360
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,989
no plan really on what they want to do. Of course, the big thing here is

1361
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,989
our economy. What you saw was an incredibly passionate argument by

1362
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,989
the Remain side on how Britain is leading in Europe in ensuring we've

1363
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,989
got a single market that works for us, in sorting out and finalising

1364
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,989
trade deals with other countries. Countries. Juxtapose that on the

1365
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,989
obsession with immigration, which nobody denies is an issue... Any

1366
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,989
regrets on how that campaign, Project Fear or Project Economy is

1367
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,989
going, when the Chancellor is talking about dropping house prices,

1368
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,989
raising taxes, the need for an austerity Budget? There's a huge

1369
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,989
range of opinion from Frances O'Grady, the leader of a trade union

1370
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,989
moment of 6 million people, from businesses, environmental groups,

1371
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,989
sports stars saying this will be bad for our economy. It is not just bad

1372
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,989
for our economy but we get a lot already. That's quite a positive

1373
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,989
message. And still you have just seen Michael Gove asked to say

1374
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,989
whether he will return the ?600,000 donation given by a former member of

1375
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,989
the BNP, the third largest donation to the Vote Leave campaign, asked

1376
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,989
whether they will return that... He said he is thinking about it. Chuka

1377
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,989
Umunna, thank you. So there are little more than 48 hours remaining

1378
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,989
for the campaigns to get their message across. Polling stations in

1379
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,989
the referendum open on Thursday morning at 7.00am. So journalists

1380
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,989
are getting quite a lot of attention, as you can imagine, as

1381
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,989
the two sides vie for a favourable write-up tomorrow. What's their

1382
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,989
verdict? Isabel Oakeshott of the Daily Mail and Steve Richard of the

1383
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,989
Independent. What is your take on tonight? It is hard, if you know

1384
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,989
your position and that of your paper to write anything different? It is

1385
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,989
one figure missing from tonight's debate, and that's the Prime

1386
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,989
Minister. It was interesting he didn't feel able to take part in a

1387
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,989
head to head debate. Voters would have liked that. There was that

1388
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,989
moment for the Remain side when they made the mistake I think of

1389
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,989
mentioning his renegotiation that. Prompted a lot of jeers from the

1390
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,989
audience, because his renegotiation throughout this campaign has been

1391
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,989
shown to be a sham. Absolutely not. I think David Cameron made the right

1392
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,989
call not to be here. If he had been here all we would be talking about

1393
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,989
now is Boris Johnson versus David Cameron. I think the Remain camp

1394
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,989
made the right call in bringing in Ruth Davidson, Sadiq Khan, two

1395
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,989
people we haven't seen that much in the context of this debate, but on a

1396
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,989
bit of a political roll at the moment. It felt fresher. Let's be

1397
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,989
honest there isn't a fresh argument to be had in this debate, which has

1398
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,989
been going on for about 28 years, but it felt fresher with those two.

1399
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,989
Did you feel there was a win here? I know this is the pin room, where the

1400
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,989
narrative is decided. Did you emerge from that feeling differently from

1401
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,989
how you went on? It is always difficult as a commentator listening

1402
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,989
to debates like this, because you hear great performances from both

1403
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,989
sides. I want to acknowledge that Ruth Davidson on the Remain side

1404
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,989
gave a sensational performance. I do think time and again the Remain side

1405
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,989
has been shown to come up short on immigration. That's what I think

1406
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,989
will get them. Future Tory leaders for Conservative there as well on

1407
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,989
either side? That's part of the prism through which this is being

1408
